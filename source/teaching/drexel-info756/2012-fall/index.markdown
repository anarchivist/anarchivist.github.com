### <span id="overview">Overview</span>

* *Instructor:* Mark A. Matienzo, <mam586@drexel.edu>
* *Office hours:* See below (contact as needed)
* *Required textbook:* Ross Harvey, *Digital Curation: A How-To-Do It Manual.* New York: Neal-Schuman, 2010. ISBN 9781555706944. All other required readings will be are available online (through Drexel University's electronic resources, as freely available resources, or included on Blackboard).

### <span id="description">Course Description</span>

This course will explore concepts, principles, and practice for the preservation of digital information resources. Digital preservation is a fundamental issue for anyone responsible for the creation or management of digital information. The class will address conceptual models, policy frameworks, technical approaches and requirements, and a number of case studies of real-world digital preservation projects and systems.

The class will consist of weekly lectures, supplemented by readings, discussion, and assignments. Each week will focus on specific primary topics, but students should seek connections between the topics and the application of principals across domains and different types of digital preservation problems. Furthermore, each week's concepts will build on concepts and material introduced and discussed in previous weeks. In discussion, students are encouraged to bring up past experience when relevant to the current week's topic.

### <span id="policies">Policies and Guidelines</span>

This course follows all University policies and procedures, including those for the accommodation for students with disabilities and for observance religious holidays. Fore more information, see the following pages:

* <http://www.drexel.edu/oed/policies/>
* <http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/>

#### Attendance

Students are expected to "attend class" virtually by following lectures, completing assigned readings in advance of class, participating in discussion, and/or submitting assignments on time. **If a student does not participate in a week's class, it will be considered an "absence."**

Excused absences from class are granted in cases approved by the Drexel University Office of the Provost. These include: 1) absences due to University Sponsored Activities where the student seeks approval at least two weeks in advance of the absence, 2) religious observances where the student makes the request at the beginning of term, and 3) catastrophic events such as illness, bereavement, accident, or fire, and the student provides documentation to provide perspective that class absence is warranted. It is expected that students seeking an approved absence develop a plan and timetable to make up the missed coursework. 

Students may have **one unexcused absence** for the term. *Each further unexcused absence will result in a one-level grade reduction in your final course grade* (e.g., a B+ final grade lowered to a B). To avoid being charged with an unexcused absence, students should at least check into the discussion each week, even if they are not going to make substantive comments. More information about class absences can be found at the Office of the Provost at <http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policyweb/absence.html>.

#### Grading Scale

All assignments are assigned point grades based on the percentage to which they count towards your final grade. For example, an assignment worth 20% of your final grade has a maximum possible grade of 20 points.

For final grades, the grading scale is as follows:

* A+ = 99-100
* A = 94-98
* A- = 90-93
* B+ = 86-89
* B = 82-85
* B- = 78-81
* C+ = 74-77
* C = 70-73

In the event that your numerical grade falls between two letter grades, your grade will be rounded up if the decimal value is 0.5 or greater; otherwise, it will be rounded down.

#### Class Preparation and Scheduling

* Class runs from **6 PM Eastern Time on Monday** to the following Sunday.
* Assignments are due **no later** than 6 PM on Monday of the specified week unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor.
* Students are expected to complete all readings for a given week **before the start of class** with the exception of Week 1. See "Readings" below for more details.
* This class does not use PowerPoint or Class Capture for lectures. You should keep up with the lectures by reading the lecture notes after class begins for that week.

#### Guidelines for Assignments

**Any requests for extensions must be made prior to the assignment’s due date.** Exceptions to this will generally only be considered as a result of serious emergencies.

**While assignment length is a guideline, it is also significant.** Because students tend to use various fonts and margins, I have included approximate word counts for assignments rather than page numbers.

**Correct spelling, proper grammar, clear phrasing, and proper and accurate citations are all *essential* in your assignments.** Ignoring these issues within your assignments will lead to your grade being reduced. If you are concerned about the quality of your writing, please contact me or consider using the services of the [Drexel Writing Center](http://drexel.edu/engphil/about/DrexelWritingCenter/).

**Citations should be formatted consistently, using preferably Chicago/Turabian, MLA, or APA style.** The particular citation style does not matter, but being consistent in the formatting of your citations does. 

**Assignments should be submitted via the Blackboard assignments section – not the digital dropbox.** If Blackboard is down or you are having other problems submitting your assignments via Blackboard, please let me know immediately.

**All submitted assignments must include Drexel’s Academic Honesty Certification Statement. Any assignment missing the Academic Honesty Certification Statement *will not be graded* until it is resubmitted including the Certification Statement.** In order to raise awareness about academic dishonesty and reduce cases of academic dishonesty in the College, the iSchool policy requires that all syllabi contain the notice that students must include the following certification page with all deliverables (for example: papers, projects, exams) indicating that the work submitted is their own. Syllabi must include notification about this and indicate that deliverables will not be graded without this certification page. For more information, please visit the following page: <http://www.drexel.edu/studentlife/judicial/honesty.html>. The certification text follows:

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

> I certify that:
>
> * This paper/project/exam is entirely my own work.
>
> * I have not quoted the words of any other person from a printed source or a website without indicating what has been quoted and providing an appropriate citation.
> 
> * I have not submitted this paper / project to satisfy the requirements of any other course.
> 
> Signature \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<br/>
> Date \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

#### Questions, Assistance, Etc.

* I will have open "office hours" every Tuesday from 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM Eastern Time, held in Wimba Classroom and on Blackboard IM. Any questions about course content, assignments, and the like are welcome here.
* You can also use the "Lifeline" discussion board on Blackboard to ask questions.
* If you would like to ask me a question privately, please contact me via email.

#### Course Evaluations

Course evaluations are a required element of every course in the iSchool. Evaluation forms are completely anonymous; in addition, the instructors do not have access to evaluation results until after they have turned in the grades for their classes. The information in the evaluations provides feedback to the instructor, helps the College improve classes and teaching, and is used by administrators in annual faculty performance reviews. Please be part of this integral process by submitting a course evaluation at the end of this term.

### Assignments, Student Evaluation, and Course Requirements

#### Required Readings

You are expected to complete the readings for a given week before the start of class that week, with the exception of week 1. Please complete Week 1’s readings by the middle of Week 1 if possible.

The lectures will both build on and supplement the material in the readings. In some cases, assigned readings may only require you to skim them or are considered optional. In those cases, the readings will be denoted in Blackboard by the words **[SKIM]** or **[OPTIONAL]** in their title.

If you are having difficulty locating or accessing a reading, please post a message to the Lifeline board on Blackboard.

#### Class Participation (20%)

Students are expected to participate in discussion boards on a regular basis, preferably every week. You are free to create a new discussion topic, but whenever possible you should attempt to continue the discussion of an existing topics for your own benefit, as well as that of your fellow students and your instructor.

Students have until 6 PM Eastern Time on the following Monday to post comments. In general, I will not be providing weekly discussion questions to guide the conversation, so feel free to raise points that you have identified in your response papers (see below). I may post a topic if discussion does not seem to happen naturally. Posts may also address the readings and the other materials that are part of that week’s assignments as well as any other topic relevant to a given week’s content.

You are expected to participate **nine** of the ten weeks of class, with **eight of the those demonstrating substantive evidence of participation.** If a student posts more than eight weeks, the highest eight grades will be counted. However, the grades are assigned based on the quality of the posts rather than the quantity. See also Attendance (above) for a discussion of absences. To ensure that you are not charged with an unexcused absence, you should at least check in during the weeks you are not planning to make a substantive comment.

Posts will be assessed based on four criteria:

* Relevance of the post to the question posed and/or the conversation taking place in the – i.e., the degree to which a post advances the discussion, either by clarifying, extending, or deepening it.
* Thoughtfulness of the post – i.e., level of insight reflected in the post.
* Depth of understanding of the assigned materials reflected in the post – i.e., level of preparation reflected in the post.
* Inclusion of relevant materials outside of the assigned readings – i.e., the degree to which the post adds to the understanding of the questions or discussion by bringing in new information or perspectives from other sources.

Midterm grades for participation will be distributed around weeks 5 to 6.
