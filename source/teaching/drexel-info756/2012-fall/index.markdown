### Overview

* *Instructor:* Mark A. Matienzo, <mam586@drexel.edu>
* *Office hours:* See below and contact as needed
* *Required textbook:* Ross Harvey, *Digital Curation: A How-To-Do It Manual.*
New York: Neal-Schuman, 2010. ISBN 9781555706944. All other required readings 
will be are available online (through Drexel University's electronic 
resources, as freely available resources, or included on Blackboard).

### <span id="description">Course Description</span>

This course will explore concepts, principles, and practice for the
preservation of digital information resources. Digital preservation is a
fundamental issue for anyone responsible for the creation or management of
digital information. The class will address conceptual models, policy
frameworks, technical approaches and requirements, and a number of case
studies of real-world digital preservation projects and systems.

The class will consist of weekly lectures, supplemented by readings,
discussion, and assignments. Each week will focus on specific primary topics,
but students should seek connections between the topics and the application
of principals across domains and different types of digital preservation
problems. Furthermore, each week's concepts will build on concepts and
material introduced and discussed in previous weeks. In discussion, students
are encouraged to bring up past experience when relevant to the current
week's topic.

### <span id="policies">Policies and Guidelines</span>

This course follows all University policies and procedures, including those 
for the accommodation for students with disabilities and for observance 
religious holidays. Fore more information, see the following pages:

* <http://www.drexel.edu/oed/policies/>
* <http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/>

#### Attendance

Students are expected to "attend class" virtually by following lectures,
completing assigned readings in advance of class, participating in
discussion, and/or submitting assignments on time. **If a student does
not participate in a week's class, it will be considered an "absence."**

Excused absences from class are granted in cases approved by the Drexel
University Office of the Provost. These include: 1) absences due to University
Sponsored Activities where the student seeks approval at least two weeks in
advance of the absence, 2) religious observances where the student makes the
request at the beginning of term, and 3) catastrophic events such as illness,
bereavement, accident, or fire, and the student provides documentation to
provide perspective that class absence is warranted. It is expected that
students seeking an approved absence develop a plan and timetable to make up
the missed coursework.

Students may have **one unexcused absence** for the term. *Each further
unexcused absence will result in a one-level grade reduction in your final
course grade* (e.g., a B+ final grade lowered to a B). To avoid being charged
with an unexcused absence, students should at least check into the discussion
each week, even if they are not going to make substantive comments. More
information about class absences can be found at the Office of the Provost at
<http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policyweb/absence.html>.

#### Grading Scale

All assignments are assigned point grades based on the percentage to which
they count towards your final grade. For example, an assignment worth 20% of
your final grade has a maximum possible grade of 20 points.

For final grades, the grading scale is as follows:

* A+ = 99-100
* A = 94-98
* A- = 90-93
* B+ = 86-89
* B = 82-85
* B- = 78-81
* C+ = 74-77
* C = 70-73

In the event that your numerical grade falls between two letter grades, your
grade will be rounded up if the decimal value is 0.5 or greater; otherwise, it
will be rounded down.

#### Class Preparation and Scheduling

* Class runs from **6 PM Eastern Time on Monday** to the following Sunday.
* Assignments are due **no later** than 6 PM on Monday of the specified week 
 unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor.
* Students are expected to complete all readings for a given week
 **before the start of class** with the exception of Week 1. See "Readings" 
 below for more details.
* This class does not use PowerPoint or Class Capture for lectures. You
 should keep up with the lectures by reading the lecture notes after class 
 begins for that week.

#### Guidelines for Assignments

**Any requests for extensions for a particular assignment must be made prior
to its due date.** Exceptions to this will generally only be considered as a
result of serious emergencies.

**While assignment length is a guideline, it is also significant.** Because
students tend to use various fonts and margins, I have included approximate
word counts for assignments rather than page numbers.

**Correct spelling, proper grammar, clear phrasing, and proper and accurate
citations are all *essential* in your assignments.** Ignoring these issues
within your assignments will lead to your grade being reduced. If you are
concerned about the quality of your writing, please contact me or consider
using the services of the
[Drexel Writing Center](http://drexel.edu/engphil/about/DrexelWritingCenter/).

**Citations should be formatted consistently, using preferably
Chicago/Turabian, MLA, or APA style.** The particular citation style does not
matter, but being consistent in the formatting of your citations does.

**Assignments should be submitted via the Blackboard assignments section - not
the digital dropbox.** If Blackboard is down or you are having other problems
submitting your assignments via Blackboard, please let me know immediately.
**I do not accept assignments via email without prior arrangements.**

**All submitted assignments must include Drexel's Academic Honesty
Certification Statement. Any assignment missing the Academic Honesty
Certification Statement *will not be graded* until it is resubmitted including
the Certification Statement.** In order to raise awareness about academic
dishonesty and reduce cases of academic dishonesty in the College, the iSchool
policy requires that all syllabi contain the notice that students must include
the following certification page with all deliverables (for example: papers,
projects, exams) indicating that the work submitted is their own. Syllabi must
include notification about this and indicate that deliverables will not be
graded without this certification page. For more information, please visit the
following page: <http://www.drexel.edu/studentlife/judicial/honesty.html>. The
certification text follows:

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

> I certify that:
>
> * This paper/project/exam is entirely my own work.
>
> * I have not quoted the words of any other person from a printed source or 
a website without indicating what has been quoted and providing an 
appropriate citation.
> 
> * I have not submitted this paper / project to satisfy the requirements of
any other course.
> 
> Signature \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<br/>
> Date \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

#### Questions, Assistance, Etc.

* You can use the "Lifeline" discussion board on Blackboard to ask questions
related to the class, assignments, etc. There is an option to ask questions
anonymously as well.
* I will have public "office hours" for every Tuesday
from 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM Eastern Time (unless noted otherwise), held in Wimba
Classroom. Any questions about course content, assignments, and the like are
welcome here. 
* If you would like to ask me a question privately or would
like to set up another time to talk, please contact me via email.

#### Course Evaluations

Course evaluations are a required element of every course in the iSchool.
Evaluation forms are completely anonymous; in addition, the instructors do not
have access to evaluation results until after they have turned in the grades
for their classes. The information in the evaluations provides feedback to the
instructor, helps the College improve classes and teaching, and is used by
administrators in annual faculty performance reviews. Please be part of this
integral process by submitting a course evaluation at the end of this term.

### Assignments, Student Evaluation, and Course Requirements

#### Readings

You are expected to complete the readings for a given week before the start of
class that week, with the exception of week 1. Please complete Week 1's
readings by the middle of Week 1 if possible. The readings for a given week
are listed in the Course Schedule below.

The lectures will both build on and supplement the material in the readings.
In some cases, assigned readings may only require you to skim them or are
considered optional. In those cases, the readings will be denoted in
Blackboard by the words **[SKIM]** or **[OPTIONAL]** in their title.

If you are having difficulty locating or accessing a reading, please post a
message to the Lifeline board on Blackboard.

#### Class Participation (20%)

Students are expected to participate in discussion boards on a regular basis,
preferably every week. You are free to create a new discussion topic, but
whenever possible you should attempt to continue the discussion of an existing
topics for your own benefit, as well as that of your fellow students and your
instructor.

Students have until 6 PM Eastern Time on the following Monday to post
comments. In general, I will not be providing weekly discussion questions to
guide the conversation, so feel free to raise points that you have identified
in your response papers (see below). I may post a topic if discussion does not
seem to happen naturally. Posts may also address the readings and the other
materials that are part of that week's assignments as well as any other topic
relevant to a given week's content.

You are expected to participate **nine** of the ten weeks of class, with
**eight of the those demonstrating substantive evidence of participation.** If
a student posts more than eight weeks, the highest eight grades will be
counted. However, the grades are assigned based on the quality of the posts
rather than the quantity. See also Attendance (above) for a discussion of
absences. To ensure that you are not charged with an unexcused absence, you
should at least check in during the weeks you are not planning to make a
substantive comment.

Posts will be assessed based on four criteria:

* Relevance of the post to the question posed and/or the conversation taking
place in the - i.e., the degree to which a post advances the discussion,
either by clarifying, extending, or deepening it.
* Thoughtfulness of the post - i.e., level of insight reflected in the post.
* Depth of understanding of the assigned materials reflected in the post -
i.e., level of preparation reflected in the post.
* Inclusion of relevant materials outside of the assigned readings - i.e.,
the degree to which the post adds to the understanding of the questions or
discussion by bringing in new information or perspectives from other sources.

Midterm grades for participation will be distributed around weeks 5 to 6.

#### Response Papers (10% each / 30% total)

#### Practical Exercises (5% each / 10% total)

#### Group Project (40% total)

### Course Schedule 

#### Week 1: What is Digital Preservation? (September 24)

This week will contain an overview of the course and assignments, as well as background on and overview of digital preservation, including key themes in the course and the field. We will also investigate the related idea of "digital curation."

#### Week 2: Conceptual Models: OAIS and the DCC Lifecyle (October 1)

The Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System is a conceptual
framework and an international standard for describing the components of a
digital preservation environment. We will focus on the different components
and their relationships during this week.

**Readings**

* Ross Harvey, "Chapter 3: Conceptual Models." In *Digital Curation: A How-To-
Do-It-Manual*, 33-44. New York: Neal Schuman, 2010.

    * Note: This document is long, but you should skim to get a high-level
    understanding of how the different parts of the Reference Model fit
    together. This week's lecture and the other readings will explain things
    in more detail. The most important sections to skim in advance of class
    are section 2, section 3, and section 4.1, and skim sections 4.2 and 4.3
    if you can complete them. Appendix F will give you a good high-level view
    of the relationships in section 4.1.

#### Week 3: Ingest, Selection, Provenance and Authenticity (October 8)

Ingest is the function within the OAIS Reference Model that accepts packages
of digital information into a preservation system. Digital preservation
requires processes of assessment and selection to determine the proper course
of action. We will review means of identifying requirements and establishing
selection criteria to ensure appropriate and responsible allocation of
resources. We will also discuss the concepts of authenticity and provenance,
or origin, of digital information and how it both relates to and distinct from
the related archival concepts.

#### Week 4: Significant Properties and Preservation Planning (October 15)

Preservation planning is an important component of the OAIS model, and
involves both monitoring a preservation environment and its surroundings as
well as developing preservation plans for specific types or collections of
digital information. Preservation plans must address the significant
properties of digital information, which are the characteristics of an
information object that must be maintained to ensure that object's continued
access, use, and meaning over time.

This week will focus on particular requirements and challenges related to the
long-term viability and accessibility of digital information, such as the
selection and recording appropriate metadata, or information about the
information itself. We will also discuss some issues relating to the viability
or obsolescence of file formats.

#### Week 6: Digital Preservation Strategies (October 29)

This week focuses on specific strategies for ensuring the longevity of digital
information and heavily focuses on case studies. Emulation duplicates the
function of a full computer system. Migration involves transforming digital
information into a different format than in which it was originally held. We
will also discuss the impact of storage media on digital preservation.

#### Week 8: Compliance, Auditing, and Certification (November 12)

Certification and auditing are important steps to determine the soundness,
resilience, and long-term viability of institutions and programs that
undertake digital preservation initiatives. We will look at a few key
initiatives that evaluate preservation environments as well as a few case
studies.

#### November 19-25 - No Class

#### Week 9: Resource Allocation and Sustainability (November 26)

Resources are a key component of ensuring the operation of a digital
preservation initiative over time. There has been considerable work over the
last few years that addresses issues related to the sustainability of
preservation programs. We will look at some emerging work in the field,
including sustainability analyses and cost models for digital preservation.
