### Overview

* *Instructor:* Mark A. Matienzo, <mam586@drexel.edu>
* *Office hours:* See below and contact as needed
* *Required textbook:* Harvey, Ross. *Digital Curation: A How-To-Do It Manual.*
New York: Neal-Schuman, 2010. ISBN 9781555706944. All other required readings 
will be are available online (through Drexel University's electronic 
resources, as freely available resources, or included on Blackboard).

### <span id="description">Course Description</span>

This course will explore concepts, principles, and practice for the
preservation of digital information resources. Digital preservation is a
fundamental issue for anyone responsible for the creation or management of
digital information. The class will address conceptual models, policy
frameworks, technical approaches and requirements, and a number of case
studies of real-world digital preservation projects and systems.

The class will consist of weekly lectures, supplemented by readings,
discussion, and assignments. Each week will focus on specific primary topics,
but students should seek connections between the topics and the application
of principals across domains and different types of digital preservation
problems. Furthermore, each week's concepts will build on concepts and
material introduced and discussed in previous weeks. In discussion, students
are encouraged to bring up past experience when relevant to the current
week's topic.

### <span id="policies">Policies and Guidelines</span>

#### Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

This course follows all Drexel University policies and procedures regarding
academic integrity (see
<http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/academic_dishonesty.asp> for more
details). All assignments submitted must be your own work, with sources
properly cited. Any incidence of plagiarism or other academic dishonesty will
result in an F for the course. See "Guidelines for Assignments" below as an
academic honesty assignment is required on each assignment submitted.

#### Support for Students with Disabilities

Drexel University ensures people with disabilities will have an equal
opportunity to participate in its programs and activities. Members and guests
of the Drexel community who have a disability need to register with the Office
of Disability Services (ODS), if requesting auxiliary aids, accommodations,
and services to participate in Drexel Universityâ€™s programs. For further
information please contact the ODS:

* Web: <http://www.drexel.edu/ods/>
* Postal address: 3201 Arch St, Suite 210, Philadelphia, PA, 19104
* Telephone: (215) 895-1401
* TTY: (215) 895-2299

#### Support for Equality and Diversity

Drexel University strives to promote an environment of equality of opportunity
and compliance with University policies and federal, state and local laws
prohibiting discrimination based upon race, color, religion, gender (sex),
marital status, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability and veteran
status. Students, faculty and staff with questions about or complaints
concerning discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation should contact the
Office of Equality and Diversity:

* Web: <http://www.drexel.edu/oed/>
* Telephone: (215) 895-1403

#### Course Drop/Withdrawal

Students may drop a course before the end of the second week of classes. More
information about dropping a course can be found at
<http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course_drop.asp>.

Students may withdraw from a course before the end of the sixth week of
classes. More information about withdrawing from a course can be found at
<http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course_withdrawal_policy.asp>.

#### Attendance

Students are expected to "attend class" virtually by following lectures,
completing assigned readings in advance of class, participating in
discussion, and/or submitting assignments on time. **If a student does
not participate in a week's class, it will be considered an "absence."**

Excused absences from class are granted in cases approved by the Drexel
University Office of the Provost. These include: 1) absences due to University
Sponsored Activities where the student seeks approval at least two weeks in
advance of the absence, 2) religious observances where the student makes the
request at the beginning of term, and 3) catastrophic events such as illness,
bereavement, accident, or fire, and the student provides documentation to
provide perspective that class absence is warranted. It is expected that
students seeking an approved absence develop a plan and timetable to make up
the missed coursework.

Students may have **one unexcused absence** for the term. *Each further
unexcused absence will result in a one-level grade reduction in your final
course grade* (e.g., a B+ final grade lowered to a B). To avoid being charged
with an unexcused absence, students should at least check into the discussion
each week, even if they are not going to make substantive comments. More
information about class absences can be found at the Office of the Provost at
<http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policyweb/absence.html>.

#### Grading Scale

All assignments are assigned point grades based on the percentage to which
they count towards your final grade. For example, an assignment worth 20% of
your final grade has a maximum possible grade of 20 points.

For final grades, the grading scale is as follows:

* A+ = 99-100
* A = 94-98
* A- = 90-93
* B+ = 86-89
* B = 82-85
* B- = 78-81
* C+ = 74-77
* C = 70-73

In the event that your numerical grade falls between two letter grades, your
grade will be rounded up if the decimal value is 0.5 or greater; otherwise, it
will be rounded down.

#### Incompletes

Incompletes will be assigned only in cases of serious emergency (e.g. medical
or family). The instructor retains the right to ask for evidence of the
emergency upon request. If granted an incomplete, you and the instructor will
set a mutually agreed-upon final due date by which all outstanding work must
be completed.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Class Preparation and Scheduling

* Class runs from **6 PM Eastern Time on Monday** to the following Sunday.
* Assignments are due **no later** than 6 PM on Monday of the specified week 
unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor.
* Students are expected to complete all readings for a given week
**before the start of class** with the exception of Week 1. See "Readings" 
below for more details.
* This class does not use PowerPoint or Class Capture for lectures. You
should keep up with the lectures by reading the lecture notes after class 
begins for that week.

#### Guidelines for Assignments

**Late assignments may not be accepted unless the instructor has granted an
extension. Any requests for extensions for a particular assignment must be
made prior to its due date.** Exceptions to this will generally only be
considered as a result of serious emergencies. In the event that I do accept
a late assignment without an extension or you turn in an assignment past the
date due associated with the extension, I will deduct 5% of the total possible
points each day that it is late (e.g. 0.5 points per day on an assignment
worth 10 points).

**While assignment length is a guideline, it is also significant.** Because
students tend to use various fonts and margins, I have included approximate
word counts for assignments rather than page numbers. **Word counts for
assignments do not include cover pages, honesty statements, citations, and the
like.**

**Correct spelling, proper grammar, clear phrasing, and proper and accurate
citations are all *essential* in your assignments.** Ignoring these issues
within your assignments will lead to your grade being reduced. If you are
concerned about the quality of your writing, please contact me or consider
using the services of the
[Drexel Writing Center](http://drexel.edu/engphil/about/DrexelWritingCenter/).

**Citations should be formatted consistently, using preferably
Chicago/Turabian, MLA, or APA style.** The particular citation style does not
matter, but being consistent in the formatting of your citations does.

**Assignments should be submitted via the Blackboard assignments section - not
the digital dropbox.** If Blackboard is down or you are having other problems
submitting your assignments via Blackboard, please let me know immediately.
**I do not accept assignments via email without prior arrangements.**

**All submitted assignments must include Drexel's Academic Honesty
Certification Statement. Any assignment missing the Academic Honesty
Certification Statement *will not be graded* until it is resubmitted including
the Certification Statement.** In order to raise awareness about academic
dishonesty and reduce cases of academic dishonesty in the College, the iSchool
policy requires that all syllabi contain the notice that students must include
the following certification page with all deliverables (for example: papers,
projects, exams) indicating that the work submitted is their own. Syllabi must
include notification about this and indicate that deliverables will not be
graded without this certification page. For more information, please visit the
following page: <http://www.drexel.edu/studentlife/judicial/honesty.html>. The
certification text follows:

> I certify that:
>
> * This paper/project/exam is entirely my own work.
>
> * I have not quoted the words of any other person from a printed source or 
a website without indicating what has been quoted and providing an 
appropriate citation.
> 
> * I have not submitted this paper / project to satisfy the requirements of
any other course.
> 
> Signature \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<br/>
> Date \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

#### Questions, Assistance, Etc.

* You can use the "Lifeline" discussion board on Blackboard to ask questions
related to the class, assignments, etc. There is an option to ask questions
anonymously as well.
* I will have public "office hours" for every Tuesday
from 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM Eastern Time (unless noted otherwise), held in Wimba
Classroom. Any questions about course content, assignments, and the like are
welcome here. 
* If you would like to ask me a question privately or would
like to set up another time to talk, please contact me via email.

#### Course Evaluations

Course evaluations are a required element of every course in the iSchool.
Evaluation forms are completely anonymous; in addition, the instructors do not
have access to evaluation results until after they have turned in the grades
for their classes. The information in the evaluations provides feedback to the
instructor, helps the College improve classes and teaching, and is used by
administrators in annual faculty performance reviews. Please be part of this
integral process by submitting a course evaluation at the end of this term.

### Assignments, Student Evaluation, and Course Requirements

#### Readings

You are expected to complete the readings for a given week before the start of
class that week, with the exception of week 1. Please complete Week 1's
readings by the middle of Week 1 if possible. The readings for a given week
are listed in the Course Schedule below. The listing below should be treated
as the authoritative listing.

The lectures will both build on and supplement the material in the readings.
In some cases, assigned readings may only require you to skim them or are
considered optional. In those cases, the readings will be denoted in
Blackboard by the words **[SKIM]** or **[OPTIONAL]** in their title.

If you are having difficulty locating or accessing a reading, please post a
message to the Lifeline board on Blackboard.

#### Class Participation (15%)

Students are expected to participate in discussion boards on a regular basis,
preferably every week. You are free to create a new discussion topic, but
whenever possible you should attempt to continue the discussion of an existing
topics for your own benefit, as well as that of your fellow students and your
instructor.

Students have until 6 PM Eastern Time on the following Monday to post
comments. In general, I will not be providing weekly discussion questions to
guide the conversation, so feel free to raise points that you have identified
in your response papers (see below). I may post a topic if discussion does not
seem to happen naturally. Posts may also address the readings and the other
materials that are part of that week's assignments as well as any other topic
relevant to a given week's content.

You are expected to participate **nine** of the ten weeks of class, with
**eight of the those demonstrating substantive evidence of participation.** If
a student posts more than eight weeks, the highest eight grades will be
counted. However, the grades are assigned based on the quality of the posts
rather than the quantity. See also Attendance (above) for a discussion of
absences. To ensure that you are not charged with an unexcused absence, you
should at least check in during the weeks you are not planning to make a
substantive comment.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

Posts will be assessed based on four criteria:

* Relevance of the post to the question posed and/or the conversation taking
place in the - i.e., the degree to which a post advances the discussion,
either by clarifying, extending, or deepening it.
* Thoughtfulness of the post - i.e., level of insight reflected in the post.
* Depth of understanding of the assigned materials reflected in the post -
i.e., level of preparation reflected in the post.
* Inclusion of relevant materials outside of the assigned readings - i.e.,
the degree to which the post adds to the understanding of the questions or
discussion by bringing in new information or perspectives from other sources.

Midterm grades for participation will be distributed around weeks 5 to 6.

#### Response Papers (10% each / 30% total)

Throughout the term, you are responsible for writing three response papers of
**800-1200 words**. For each response papers, you choose a reading from a
given class week's readings, summarize the key points in that piece, and
critique those key points. You do not need to choose a reading from the week
that the response paper is due (e.g., for Response Paper #1, you can choose a
reading from Week 1, 2, or 3). **Readings from the textbook (*Digital
Curation: A How-To-Do-It Manual*) and any reading marked [SKIM] are not to be
used for response papers.** Whenever possible, justify your positions based on
other assigned readings, class discussions, or other material in professional
literature on digital preservation.

**Alternate Option for Response Paper #3**

For Response Paper #3, you also have the option to write an analysis of a
digital preservation policy. A set of links to policy documents from a variety
of institutions is provided on Blackboard in the folder entitled "Policies for
Analysis." You may choose one of the policies available in this folder, but
you are also welcome to choose another institution if you can easily obtain
its policy or practices documentation. There are two exceptions to this:

* You cannot use the ICPSR documentation as it was reading for class.
* You cannot use documentation from your current employer.

Your analysis should include the following:

* A description of the initiative and its institutional context, highlighting
any particular aspects that you consider distinctive.
* An overview of its policies and guidelines (or practices, if no formal 
policies are available), including its mission, the scope of its 
responsibility and the types of material it contains, the services it 
provides, roles and responsibilities for its operations, its level of
security, and its sustainability or viability.
* A brief description of how the initiative could determine if it is 
successful or adequately addressing its mission and its needs of the user 
community.
* An overview of ways that the initiativeâ€™s policy and practice could be
strengthened.

You are not expected or required to contact staff that operate the program.

In reviewing the policy documentation, please be aware that many of these
individual documents do not stand on their own. In other words, they may refer
or link to other documentation, which you should subsequently review to
determine if it addresses important components of the initiativeâ€™s overall
preservation policies. For example, the ICPSR Digital Preservation Policy
Framework refers to more than eight other documents. You may need to do a
little additional research to find related documentation.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Hands-On Exercise (10%)

For this assignment, you will choose a hands-on exercise out from two or three
options. Each option involves undertaking a fairly straightforward task
related to preservation, such as creating descriptive metadata, identifying
file formats, etc. Along with completing the exercise, you are expected to 
write a response of **800-1200 words** that allow you to reflect on the 
exercise and its results.

More detail about this assignment is available on Blackboard.

#### Case Study Analysis (10%)

In this assignment, you will select a case study that describes a specific
digital preservation project, program, or activity, and analyze and critique
the article. To identify an appropriate case study, you can use a published
article, or a report that is available on the web, as long as it follows the
guidelines below:

* The case study was not assigned as a reading for class.
* You must choose a case study that reports on work that has been started or
completed, rather than one that only describes a plan for a project.
* The case study must be no more than five years old (i.e. published in 2007
or later).
* Your case study must also be about the preservation of digital information, 
not just about the digitization of "analog" materials.
* You also **must get the approval of the instructor** for your case study no 
later than the beginning of Week 8.

Your analysis should be **800-1200 words** and should include a synopsis of 
the article, a description of particular preservation strategies, 
technologies, or techniques used, and analysis of any lessons learned, 
particularly if they could impact future projects. Regardless whether you 
agree or disagree with the approach the project took, describe the reasons why
you feel that way in detail.

Potential sources for your case studies can include, but are not limited to
the following:

* Archives journals, like *American Archivist*, *Archivaria*, *Archival
Science*, etc.
* Digital curation/digital preservation journals, like *International Journal
for Digital Curation*
* Library technology/digital library journals, like *Library Hi-Tech*,
*D-Lib*, *Ariadne*, *Code4lib Journal*, etc.
* Papers from conferences, like iPRES, DigCCurr, Society of American 
Archivists, Association of Moving Image Archivists, etc.
* Case studies from professional organizations, like the Digital Curation
Centre, NDIIPP, the Digital Preservation Coalition, Open Planets Foundation,
etc.
* The Digital Curation Bibliography:
<http://digital-scholarship.org/dcpb/dcb.htm>

#### Group Project (35%)

This is a group project designed to allow you gain experience assessing the
preservation needs of a collection of digital information important to you and
your classmates and developing a detailed plan that would help ensure the
preservation of that information. Each group will usually have four or five
students total, but this project should be manageable with groups of at least
three students. The instructor will form the groups for you and list the
groups by the beginning of Week 2. 

You may use any technology you'd like to collaborate with the members of your
group, including but not limited to group discussion boards, email, Skype,
etc. If any problems occur with the group collaboration, please notify me at
the time that these occur. Although I can consider relative contributions, I
cannot make any allowance for problems that are reported after assignments
have been graded.

This assignment has three parts: a draft preservation plan (Part 1), a final
report (Part 2), and an evaluation of your peers in your group (Part 3). For
Parts 1 and 2, you should ensure that your submitted assignments are written
in a consistent voice that represents the entire group. Part 3 is submitted
individually and will be used in grade apportionment.

**Part 1: Draft Preservation Plan (not assessed)**

The first part of this assignment is a draft of your preservation plan. While
not graded, it is nonetheless a mandatory part of the assignment. This gives
the instructor an opportunity to give you feedback and guidance about how to
expand and improve upon this draft for the final report. 

For this part of the assignment, your group should ensure you do the
following:

* Undertake the selection of a common area of interest across your group, and
identify or create a collection of digital information for that interest. This
can include websites, audio or video recordings, software, textual material,
etc., and should include more than one of these types of digital media.
* Develop a description of that shared interest and the motivation for
preserving that material. Identify the context of the collection and provide
information about its creation, and describe it in any other way you think is
relevant in terms of how it gets preserved.
* Perform an appraisal of the contents of your collection and identify a 
subset of that collection that you consider worthy of long-term preservation.
Your group should describe its appraisal decision and selection process in
detail. In addition, identify any important needs for this subset that would
need to be addressed for that information to be preserved appropriately.
* Begin developing a preservation plan to address the identified needs. Your
preliminary plan should address potential strategies and actions, technical
considerations such as file formats or metadata requirements, and potential
compromises that you will need to make. These may include considerations of
intellectual property rights, and in reflecting on these, describe the 
implications on your plan of action.

Be sure to address the big picture as well as focusing on the details, such as
whether you think this is feasible, potential expertise or staffing needed for
this project, and how much time and/or money it would take. 

**Part 2: Final Report (30%)**

Using the feedback you received on Part 1, rewrite and expand upon your
preservation plan to thoroughly identify the collection of information and its
requirements for preservation. Treat this as if you were developing a funding
proposal for a grant agency or a private foundation. Your report should
include the following components:

* A revised version of your documentation from part 1 of your assignment. 
Ensure you adequately address the feedback provided by the instructor, such as
expanding things in need of more detail. 
* A detailed staffing plan, identifying the roles, time allocation, and 
expertise needed to actualize this plan.
* A detailed timeline and work plan that breaks down the necessary work into 
multiple phases, with a reasonable estimate about how long each phase and set
of tasks will take.
* A detailed description of any additional tangible resources (e.g. hardware 
or software, etc.) or services that you would need.
* Identification of any significant risks or challenges for the project, and
how your group intends to address them.
* An overview of similar projects or those which may have some relevance to
how your group intends to execute its plan. 
* A brief outline of how you would evaluate the success of your project.
Stating that you intend to evaluate the success of how well the information 
was preserved over the long term is not adequate. Assume that  your project 
has a finite first phase and that you need to evaluate your
project to get further support.

You are not expected to prepare a budget.

While there is not a specific length requirement, I expect that most final 
reports will be between **3500-5000 words.** Ensure that your final report
shares one common voice. You can refer to specific discussions within your
group, but the writing style should be consistent throughout.

Sample successful (i.e. funded) grant proposals that can be used for ideas
can be found from the following links:

* Institute of Museum and Library Services:
<http://www.imls.gov/recipients/grantsearch.aspx> (see National Leadership

* National Endowment for the Humanities - Preservation and Access Research and Development:
<http://www.neh.gov/grants/preservation/preservation-and-access-research-and-development>
(see Recently Funded Awards and Sample Application Narratives)

**Part 3: Peer Evaluation (5%)**

All students are required to submit a peer evaluation at the end of the term
that indicated the relative contribution of their group members to the
project. These evaluations are used for grade apportionment. It is critical
that you take these seriously. You will complete a peer evaluation form for
each member of your group, including yourself. In addition, write
approximately 150-200 words about each member of your group describing
specific strengths, weaknesses and moments of excellence or problems that
you've identified. 

The peer evaluation form is available on Blackboard.

### Course Schedule 

#### Week 1: What is Digital Preservation? (September 24)

This week will contain an overview of the course and assignments, as well as
background on and overview of digital preservation, including key themes in
the course and the field. We will also investigate the related idea of
"digital curation."

#### Week 2: Conceptual Models: OAIS and the DCC Lifecycle (October 1)

The Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System is a conceptual
framework and an international standard for describing the components of a
digital preservation environment. We will focus on the different components
and their relationships during this week. We will also be looking at the DCC
Lifecycle model, as developed by the Digital Curation Centre.

#### Week 3: Ingest, Selection, Provenance and Authenticity (October 8)

**Assignment Due: Response Paper #1**

Ingest is the function within the OAIS Reference Model that accepts packages
of digital information into a preservation system. Digital preservation
requires processes of assessment and selection to determine the proper course
of action. We will review means of identifying requirements and establishing
selection criteria to ensure appropriate and responsible allocation of
resources. We will also discuss the concepts of authenticity and provenance,
or origin, of digital information and how it both relates to and distinct from
the related archival concepts.

#### Week 4: Significant Properties and Preservation Planning (October 15)

Preservation planning is an important component of the OAIS model, and
involves both monitoring a preservation environment and its surroundings as
well as developing preservation plans for specific types or collections of
digital information. Preservation plans must address the significant
properties of digital information, which are the characteristics of an
information object that must be maintained to ensure that object's continued
access, use, and meaning over time.

#### Week 6: Digital Preservation Strategies (October 29)

**Assignment Due: Group Project Part 1**

This week focuses on specific strategies for ensuring the longevity of digital
information and heavily focuses on case studies. Emulation duplicates the
function of a full computer system. Migration involves transforming digital
information into a different format than in which it was originally held. We
will also discuss the impact of storage media on digital preservation.
