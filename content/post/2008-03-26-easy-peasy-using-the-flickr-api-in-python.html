title: 'Easy Peasy: Using the Flickr API in Python'
---
<p>Since I'm often required to hit the ground running at $MPOW on projects, I was a little concerned when I roped myself into assisting our photo archives with a Flickr project. The first goal was to get a subset of the photos uploaded, and quickly. Googling and poking around the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/">Cheeseshop</a> led me to <a href="http://flickrapi.sf.net/">Beej's FlickrAPI for Python</a>. Little did I know that it would be dead simple to get this project going. To authenticate:</p>
<pre lang="python">
def create_session(api_key, api_secret):
    """Creates as session using FlickrAPI."""
    session = flickrapi.FlickrAPI(api_key, api_secret)
    (token, frob) = session.get_token_part_one(perms='write')
    if not token:
        raw_input("Hit return after authorizing this program with Flickr")
    session.get_token_part_two((token, frob))
    return session
</pre>
<p>That was less painful than the PPD test for tuberculosis. Oh, and uploading?</p>
<pre lang="python">
flickr.upload(filename=fn, title=title, description=desc, tags=tags, callback=status)</pre>
<p>Using this little code plus a few other tidbits, I created an uploader that parses CSV files of image metadata exported from an Access database. And when done, the results look a little something <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24827657@N03/">like this</a>.</p>
