title: 'Morristown Calling: MARAC Fall Meeting'
---
<p>I'm at the Westin Governor Morris in Morristown, New Jersey for the <a href="http://www.lib.umd.edu/MARAC/"><acronym title="Mid-Atlantic Regional Archives Conference">MARAC</acronym></a> Fall Meeting. I just got back from visiting the <a href="http://www.morrismuseum.org/">Morris Museum</a> with a few folks, and now I'm enjoying the (expensive) wireless connection here. This time around I don't know so many folks here, so shoot me an e-mail or comment if you're in attendance. Expect a more detailed post soon; I'm exhausted from being up early to catch Amtrak!</p>
