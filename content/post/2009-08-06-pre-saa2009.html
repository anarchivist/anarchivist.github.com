title: Everything is Bigger in Texas, Including My Talks on The Semantic Web
---
<p>I'll be at the <a href="http://archivists.org/conference/austin2009/index.asp">Society of American Archivists Annual Meeting</a> next week in Austin, Texas. It looks to be a jam-packed week for me, with a full-day Standards Committee/<abbr title="Technical Subcommittee on Descriptive Standards">TSDS</abbr> meeting on Tuesday, followed by <a href="http://www.thatcampaustin.org/">THATCamp Austin</a> in the evening, an (expanded version of my) presentation on Linked Data and Archival Description during the EAD Roundtable on Wednesday, and Thursday's session (number 101): "Building, Managing, and Participating in Online Communities: Avoiding Culture Shock Online" (with <a href="http://spellboundblog.com/">Jeanne Kramer-Smyth</a>, Deborah Wythe, and Camille Cloutier). And to think I haven't even considered which other sessions I'm going to! Anyhow, I hope to see you there, and please make either or both of my presentations if you can.</p>
