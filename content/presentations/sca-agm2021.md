The past year has been a profound challenge to everyone, including archivists and the communities they serve. We have struggled to respond and evolve across frequently turbulent connections between maintenance, innovation, and care, as well as increased demands from researchers and our own institutions to provide service. As always, we also experience amidst our own fears of relevance and being understood. In this talk, we will explore these interconnections, our tendency to be defensive, the potential threats facing archives from certain innovations, and our own continued collaborations as networks of care.
