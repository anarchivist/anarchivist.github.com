summary: What I've been busy with lately

What have I been up to lately?

* I moved  to Seattle! We bought a house and decided to move to be closer to our support network. We're now settling in nicely, although there's a lot of work to do to continue to get the house to be at the optimium level of cosiness.
* I'm still managing a team of software engineers and user experience designers at Stanford Libraries. We've had a busy year, especially with rolling out new services to support remote instruction and research. Most recently, our team shipped [Mirador 3.0.0](https://library.stanford.edu/blogs/digital-library-blog/2020/11/mirador-v300-released), which has been in the works for over two years including its design phase.
* I'm still recording music. I released my [latest album](https://blacktent.bandcamp.com/) on cassette a few months ago. My latest experiments have involved me getting more familiar with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), and once I'm a bit more settled I'm planning to dig in to [Orca](https://100r.co/site/orca.html). Since I haven't unpacked all my gear yet, I've been doing a lot with [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) lately.
* I got my ham radio license in August; I'd been frequenting local nets on 2 meter repeaters, but hadn't had as much time before moving.
* As fall approached, I've been shifting to listen to lower tempo music, which means a lot of [Slow Attack Ensemble](https://slowattackensemble.bandcamp.com/), [Matt Jencik](https://mattjencik.bandcamp.com/album/dream-character), [Nadja](https://nadjaluv.tumblr.com/), etc. I really like the new Hum album, and I'm really excited about the new [Mizmor/Andrew Black](https://gileadmedia.bandcamp.com/album/dialetheia) collaboration. I like making mixtapes, so get in touch.
