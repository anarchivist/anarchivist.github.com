summary: What I've been busy with lately

What have I been up to lately?

* I'm still managing a team of software engineers and user experience designers at Stanford Libraries, albeit remotely from Seattle. We are now [hiring a cohort of three software developers][5], so please apply if youre interested.
* I'm still recording music, and working on the mixes for my new EP. Since I haven't unpacked all my gear yet, I've been doing a lot with [VCV Rack][1] lately. I released my [latest album][2] on cassette a few months ago.
* I’ve been writing more than usual, in part sparked by my [recent keynote][3] at the Society of California Archivists meeting. That’s also made me look back at some of my old writing, and I’ve started grouping some of that under a [**new enclosures**][4] tag for content on my site.
* We adopted two cats named Prudence and Churro last February, and they are settling in nicely.
