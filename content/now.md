summary: What I've been busy with lately

What have I been up to lately?

* I'm getting ready to relocate from the Bay Area to Seattle! We're buying a house and moving to be closer to our support network. Buying a house is a lot of work, and so is moving...so that's a little all consuming.
* I'm still managing a team of software engineers and user experience designers at Stanford Libraries, and hiring for a [user experience designer](https://library.stanford.edu/department/digital-library-systems-and-services-dlss/jobs/user-experience-designer). We've had a busy year, especially with rolling out new services to support remote instruction and research. Most recently, our team shipped [Mirador 3.0.0](https://library.stanford.edu/blogs/digital-library-blog/2020/11/mirador-v300-released), which has been in the works for over two years including its design phase.
* I'm still recording music, albeit not as regularly (with the impending move/house search/work). I released my [latest album](https://blacktent.bandcamp.com/) on cassette a few months ago. My latest experiments have involved me getting more familiar with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), and once I'm a bit more settled I'm planning to dig in to [Orca](https://100r.co/site/orca.html).
* I got my ham radio license in August; I'd been frequenting local nets on 2 meter repeaters, but again, haven't had as much time lately.
* As fall approached, I've been shifting to listen to lower tempo music, which means a lot of [Slow Attack Ensemble](https://slowattackensemble.bandcamp.com/), [Matt Jencik](https://mattjencik.bandcamp.com/album/dream-character), [Nadja](https://nadjaluv.tumblr.com/), etc. I really like the new Hum album, and I'm really excited about the new [Mizmor/Andrew Black](https://gileadmedia.bandcamp.com/album/dialetheia) collaboration. I like making mixtapes, so get in touch.
