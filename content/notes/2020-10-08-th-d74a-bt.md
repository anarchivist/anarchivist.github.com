Last night's AX.25 failures turned into success! I followed [K1CHN's second post](https://www.k1chn.com/posts/winlink-th-d74a-now-with-more-bluetooth/) on using the TH-D74A's TNC over Bluetooth, and successfully made my first connection to a packet BBS, [N6ZX-4 on Kings Mountain](http://www.kingsmountainonline.com/community/radio-club). #hamradio
