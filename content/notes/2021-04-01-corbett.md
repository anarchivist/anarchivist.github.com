Great longform discussion with [Jon Corbett](http://joncorbett.ca/), an Indigenous computational media artist, and creator of Cree# and the Indigenous Computing Framework.

> I started to see how the living and dynamic characteristics of culture can be represented as digital structures on which to build my programmatic language; and is also one of the reasons I needed to define an “Indigenous Computing Framework”. I needed to be able to describe the system in organic terms with respect to the cultural awareness of the programming platform, so things like language sensitivities, cultural practices, digital object behaviours, etc… could be presented with this kind of “meta-language” that carries the cultural metaphoric representations and relationships to the system and extended programmatic functions.

His [extended abstract](https://doi.org/10.1145/3191697.3213802) for _Programming '18_ also shares more of his research framework.
