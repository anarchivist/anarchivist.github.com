Blackstone is also known for such great hits [acquiring SESAC, the performing rights organization](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170104005784/en/Leading-Music-Rights-Organization-SESAC-Acquired-Blackstone), and [acquiring a 50% stake to the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana from Shell for $1.2B](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140814005131/en/Vine-Oil-Gas-Blackstone-Energy-Partners-Acquire).
