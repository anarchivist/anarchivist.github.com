Yesterday, I gave the keynote at the [<abbr title="Society of California Archivists 2021 Annual General Meeting">#agm2021</abbr>](https://www.calarchivists.org/AGM-2021-Sessions-Descriptions#plenary). The session was recorded but not yet freely available. I'm hoping to rework the text for publication, but on request, I'm willing to share the text of my talk, so contact me accordingly.

Le Guin quotes." >}}
