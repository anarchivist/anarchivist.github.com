> The brilliance of the American neocolonial turn was the way it was able to divide the European notion of universal “Culture” from the anticolonial need for oppositional local and national “cultures” in order to conquer both, leaving us with little more than toothless ideas about lifestyle, “difference,” and “resistance,” and the seemingly endless distraction of ever-disenfranchising “culture politics.” The legacy of that triumphant division and conquest structures our syllabi as much as it has the direction that world history has headed in since decolonization.
