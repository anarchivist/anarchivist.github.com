Even though the air quality is really poor, I stepped outside for about 15 minutes to see if I could hear any ham radio signals from the [International Space Station](https://www.ariss.org/contact-the-iss.html). For just a tiny bit I was able to copy some QSOs on the [relatively new cross-band repeater](https://www.ariss.org/press-releases/september-2-2020/). A little too hectic for me to jump in since I couldn't remember my grid square...
