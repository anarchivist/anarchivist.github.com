I bought a second-hand Kenwood TH-D74A recently (through Craigslist). I've messed about with [APRS](https://aprs.fi/info/a/N6MAM-7) on it, used it for my [first SOTA activation](https://matienzo.org/2020/first-sota-activation/), and now am trying to get it hooked up to my Raspberry Pi to use its built-in KISS TNC for Winlink and packet BBSes. [K1CHN's post](https://www.k1chn.com/posts/winlink-on-the-th-d74-with-raspberry-pi/) has been useful. However, shortly after connecting something is leading to it "disconnecting" over USB, with `cdc_acm ...: failed to set dtr/rts` showing up in the kernel message and adding a new device file for the radio. My first guess is that it might be resolved with a choke on the USB cable, but I might try Bluetooth first... #hamradio
