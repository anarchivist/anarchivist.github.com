I've been tracking the [CZU Lightning Complex Fires](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/17/czu-august-lightning-complex/), which erupted over the last weekend after storms near me. The closest fires are about 20 miles south in San Mateo County and Santa Cruz County, although the smoke has gotten pretty bad here. I'm heartbroken for everyone impacted by this, which includes a few friends and acquaintances, and farmers from whom I get my food, who live in the [evacuation area](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f0121f7f2f0941afb3ed70529b2cee75). It's also a tremendously special part of California for me, and it feels like yet another thing added to the ceaseless current of mourning over the last six months. It also motivated me enough to finally put together a "go bag" in case we have to evacuate, and I've picked up studying for my Technician license for amateur radio as a means of coping.
