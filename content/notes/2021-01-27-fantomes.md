> Fantômes is a collaborative ghost story zine, bringing together story-telling, poetry, folklore, illustration and photography in small cobbled-together publication. It is a place to explore personal and collective ghosts, lend them a voice through summoning rituals, raw poetry or scribbled drawings and get familiar with their haunting presence.
