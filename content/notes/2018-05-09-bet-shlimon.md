>  Kirk H. Sowell, a consultant who publishes the risk newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics (for which Al-Tamimi is a contributor), initiated an exchange with me in response to a defense of the NYT’s Iraqi critics that I had written on Twitter. He opened with a tweet reading, [“Point me to the Iraqi newspaper which does in-depth investigative journalism & I’ll happily read it.”](https://twitter.com/UticaRisk/status/984118336345837568) Puzzled by the relevance of this comment to a statement about the ethics of removing archives for private ownership, I asked Sowell, [“Just to be clear: your take is that Iraqis should stay quiet about their archives being taken to the U.S. because they don’t yet have the means to establish a [NYT]-caliber paper?”](https://twitter.com/abshlimon/status/984121734910509056) He responded, [“Absolutely.”](https://twitter.com/UticaRisk/status/984349034147172352) (Callimachi herself “liked” this last tweet.)
