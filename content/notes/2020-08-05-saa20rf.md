One of the things coming out of the [#saa20 Research Forum](https://www2.archivists.org/am2020/research-forum-2020/agenda) #saa20rf are the net negative structural and strategic impacts of contingent labor on archival practice. It seems to make poor economic, practical, and long-term sense to rely on it further and it's disheartening to see that we've had to.
