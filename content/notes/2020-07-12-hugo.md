I migrated my site from Jekyll to Hugo. Indieweb-ifying Go templates is a heck of a lot easier than the pain of using Liquid. I also moved all of my old comments from Disqus to a static blob of JSON, using a [forked version](https://github.com/anarchivist/escape_from_disqus) of [Paul Hammant](https://hammant.org/)'s escape_from_disqus. How I handle new comments (non-Webmention or otherwise) is to come, but [Tom Doe's approach](https://ttntm.me/blog/static-blog-comments-hugo/) using Netlify Forms seems pretty neat.
