Spending some time post-vacation catching up reading [Ali Alkhatib][1]’s CHI 2021 paper, [“To Live in Their Utopia: Why Algorithmic Systems Create Absurd Outcomes”][2]. It’s interesting to read this paper as a conversation with broader ideas of utopia, as well as imaginaries, as well as work like Fred Moten and Stefano Harney’s [“The University and the Undercommons”][3] (_Social Text_ 22(2), 2004).
