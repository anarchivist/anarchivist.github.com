I was recently referred to [Lara Hogan](https://larahogan.me)'s post on [Week in Review](https://larahogan.me/blog/week-in-review/) writeups for teams that are internally public:

> Though the teams who reported to me were the primary audience for this doc, I kept it internally-public, meaning that anyone at the company could read and comment in it. I found that some other managers just weren’t talking about hard things that were happening, or addressing rumors that were going around, or giving heads-ups on changes, and often people on my teams would share my Week in Reviews with people on other teams, so that they could have the info too. I invited comments on the document, and didn’t “resolve” or delete comments I received, because I wanted folks to be able to see the answers to questions out in the open.

Her additional insights on how to use them to address ["Why Don't They Just...?"](https://larahogan.me/blog/why-cant-they-just/) questions are also super, super useful.
