Trying to recompile 9front kernel to get wifi working on a Raspberry Pi 4, and am closer, but still not quite there. Definitely feel like I don't know what I'm doing. In any event, I'm trying to get [Richard Miller's `ether4330` driver](https://9p.io/sources/contrib/miller/9/bcm/ether4330.c) to work under 9front (`bcm64`) and am a bit out of my depth. #plan9
