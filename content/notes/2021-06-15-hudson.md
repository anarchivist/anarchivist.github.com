> But simply removing the MLS, without fundamental structural change, is not a path towards racial liberation. It is a path towards decredentialization and devaluation of our labour, which has hurt and continues to hurt our communities disproportionately. In articulating this position, we think not only of the context of the MLS and librarianship, but of other areas of work, whether it be the cost and relevance of a teaching degree, or the cost and relevance of taxi licenses. Deregulation does not lead to utopia.
