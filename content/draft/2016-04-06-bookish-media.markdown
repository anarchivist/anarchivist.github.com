title: Bookish Media (The Story of S.)
---

Adaptation of material from Rosenbach lectures. Not part of *Track Changes,* but rather focused on "bitstreams"; change in how literary texts are authored, used, read, preserved. Literary texts become reduced to bitstreams.

Focus on question: "what is the book?" "What is a book nowadays, brought about by a major house?" A book is a file, stored as a persistent digital asset - files already have a medial format. Book as a networked object, orchestrated to generate multiple outputs. A physical book is a singular media output based on a particular execution of workflow. Books also have tie-ins to other kinds of intellectual works. A book is a bookish-type of media; medial identity through ecological presence of other media types. All books are a type of media; but share homologies of other types and formats. 

Convergence narrative; focuses on bitstream as common aspect of medial types. Content types previously separated by physical medial types have a common representation at a basic level. Media are not immaterial, etc. 

DTP packages focus on maintaining integrity against multiple assets. (Is the workflow the object?)

Books controlled as media *properties*. 

Books as defined as a set of properties that allow a particular kind of manipulation. "Being bookish means leveraging a set of features and affordances"

JJ. Abrams and Doug Dorst's *S.* - a book within a book. *Ship of Theseus* as faux ephemeral object. But who made the book? Neither publisher nor design shop - contracted by publisher to focus on individual project. Focused on developing production rather than a specific media object. Headcase Design (not credited externally on object). Books like *S.* are printed in asia because of prohibitive labor costs elsewhere. 

Extensive marginalia constructed as part of the narrative. Margianalia were comments generated using Track Commetns

Production: Word -> Scans of tracing paper -> Indesign (see [here](http://www.paperspecs.com/paper-news/s-by-jjabrams-complex-project/) and [here](http://www.paperspecs.com/paper-news/s-by-jjabrams-complex-project-2)).
