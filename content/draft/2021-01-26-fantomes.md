What does it mean when a ghost doesn't show anymore?

What does it mean when you are no longer afraid of the ghost? Or perhaps, when the ghost is afraid of you?

## care and feeding for the spectres.

you should never suggest they show up unannounced.
they queue up ever so slowly, politely - but while they can pass through walls, the spectres i know choose not to. only the truly unprepared do not know to expect their arrival.

sometimes you notice the chill as they shuffle past the thresholds and windows. feinted glowing, and the air, heavy with the scent of damp leaves and mold, stirred by their stride. but more often than not, they advance unnoticed, because they, like you, have work to do and conversations to have.

we dare expect to summon the ones we think know, demanding clarity without context, answers to questions unspoken. at the same time, as guests they can become demanding, and we have our own matters to attend to in the meantime.
