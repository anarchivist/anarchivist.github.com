title: Developing Automated Repository Deposit Modules for Archivists' Toolkit?
---
<p>I'd like to gauge interest for people to help add code to <a href="http://www.archiviststoolkit.org/">Archivists' Toolkit</a> to automate the deposit of digital objects into digital repositories. At first glance, the biggest issue is having to deal with differing deposit APIs for each repository, but using something like <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/SWORD">SWORD</a> would make sense to bridge this gap. Any and all feedback is welcome!</p>
