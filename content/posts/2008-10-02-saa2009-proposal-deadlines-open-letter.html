title: An Open Letter to SAA Council and the 2009 Program Committee
---
<p><em>I apologize for using my blog to soapbox, but I felt like this was a significant concern that I should share with my readers. If you wish to support my position, please consider sending an e-mail to SAA Council and the 2009 Program Committee Chairs.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear 2009 Program Committee Members and SAA Council Members,</p>
<p>I understand that we are nearing the deadlines for submission of proposals for sessions at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Society of American Archivists. I also understand the reasons behind having an earlier deadline than past years. However, I am deeply concerned with the decision to have the deadline set to be October 8, 2008, which is Yom Kippur and the day which the Jewish High Holidays end. As is often the case, conference proposals often coalesce at the last minute, and this is further complicated by the fact that the beginning of Rosh Hashana fell on September 29, 2008.</p>
<p>I recognize that the deadline is most likely immutable at this point, but I am asking that SAA Council and future Program Committees pay attention to when the High Holidays fall in future years. This is not an outrageous request, particularly since SAA has chosen diversity as one of its strategic priorities.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mark A. Matienzo</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have been contacted by one of the co-chairs of the 2009 Program Committee and by SAA President Frank Boles. Both have assured me that they are looking into extending the deadline, and that they will be in touch as they determine the resolution of this issue.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>EDIT PART 2:</strong> The deadline for proposal submissions has been officially changed to October 13, 2008. Thanks to SAA for their quick response!</em></p>
