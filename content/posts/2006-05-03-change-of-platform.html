title: Change of Platform

<p>Nearly a year ago I switched from <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> to <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. I chose to switch back, partially because it was capable of doing way more than I needed it to! I thought I didn't want to be limited by blog software, but apparently that's not a terribly huge concern anymore. The old site had frightfully little content (three posts in Dalliance, a few personal posts, and links to papers). I'm redoing my non-blog site with <a href="http://purl.org/"><abbr title="persistent URLS">PURLs</abbr></a> since I don't have access to an e-prints server to which I can upload my varied previous academic work. Anyhow, the important stuff is soon to come, with Dalliance possibly moving to another host (probably <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a>). Anything linking to one of the papers or my code snippets will be edited as needed.</p>
