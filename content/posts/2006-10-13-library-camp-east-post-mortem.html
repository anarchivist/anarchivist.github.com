<p>I know this post is well overdue, but the last few weeks have kept me extremely busy. <a href="http://wiki.library2.net/index.php/Library_Camp_East_2006">Library Camp East</a> was amazing; fun, thought-provoking, and inspiring. <a href="http://blyberg.net/">John Blyberg</a> and <a href="http://www.darienlibrary.org/staffpages/gray/blog/">Alan Kirk Gray</a> (as well as the rest of the <a href="http://www.darienlibrary.org/">Darien Library Staff</a>) did a heck of a job preparing for all of us descending into the auditorium. They even gave me a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jblyberg/252981492/">cool mug</a> that my co-workers envy. I also finally got to meet <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/">Dan Chudnov</a> and <a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/11458/">Casey Bisson</a>, whose blogs I've followed for a while now. <a href="http://www.librarian.net/stax/1864">Jessamyn West</a> and <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/2006/09/28/camping-out-east-coast-style/">John</a> posted nearly exhaustive lists of posts by LCE attendees for reference. (For what it's worth, Jessamyn also <a href="http://www.librarian.net/stax/1865">tips her hat to ArchivesBlogs</a> and apologizes for us not meeting at two conferences so far. I share the blame!)</p>
<p>Fortunately for my readers, I have precious little to add in terms of comments (although I tagged some <a href="http://unalog.com/tag/librarycampeast/">Library Camp-related links</a> on <a href="http://unalog.com/">Unalog</a>). I actually was called into service to lead a <a href="http://wiki.library2.net/index.php/Library_Camp_East_2006_Agenda">session</a> by accident (I happened to be scratching my nose), but I was happy enough to moderate the discussion on how techies and non-techies can learn to talk to each other. The discussion was spirited to say the least, and it seems like some good networking occured as a consequence. The OPAC discussion was pretty interesting as well.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a number of us -- <a href="http://michaelgolrick.blogspot.com/2006/09/at-library-camp-east.html">Michael Golrick</a>, Janie Hermann and Peter Bromberg of <a href="http://librarygarden.blogspot.com/">Library Garden</a>, and Kim Gabert -- talked over beer and appetizers. Much of the discussion centered around ALA, which made me realize I was pretty clueless in regards to its organization. I left early to catch the Metro North train back to Grand Central, where I met up with <a href="http://inlonesplendour.blogspot.com/">Julia</a> as we started to make our way home to Washington.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks to everybody! I'd like to see a Mid-Atlantic Library Camp; I just wish I had more resources to make it a reality.</p>
