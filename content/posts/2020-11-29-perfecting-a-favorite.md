I have a horrible sweet tooth, and I absolutely love oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I tend to bake as a means to cope with stress, and of course, more often then that means making these cookies. After making many iterations, I've settled upon this recipe as the ultimate version to which all compare. <!--more-->

## Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies

For 40-45 cookies:

* 8 ounces unsalted butter (or 4 ounces each unsalted and salted), softened
* 1 1/2 cups dark brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 cups bread flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 1 teaspoon ground Vietnamese or Korintje cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 3 cups rolled oats (or 2 cups oats/1 cup muesli)
* 8 ounces chocolate chips
* 1/4 cup flaked coconut (optional)

Steps:

1. In a large bowl, cream brown sugar into softened butter using a hand mixer or stand mixer until light and fluffy.
2. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing until just combined. Add vanilla extract and repeat.
3. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and baking powder in a medium bowl, and whisk together or stir with a fork.
4. Slowly add the flour mixture (in 3-4 portions) to the butter, sugar, and eggs, mixing until combined. As needed, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.
5. Add the oats, chocolate chips, and coconut if desired, mixing until just combined.
6. For best results, refrigerate at least 1 hour. 30 minutes can be sufficient, but save some of your dough for the following day.
7. While refrigerating, preheat oven to 350&deg; F and prepare two half sheet pans with a Silpat or parchment paper.
8. When the dough is chilled, make balls of dough approximately the size of a golf ball. Place each ball on the baking sheet and flatten with your hands, ensuring each are at least 2 inches apart.
9. Bake for 15 minutes, rotating the pans at the halfway point.
10. Transfer to a wire rack and cool for at least 5 minutes before eating.
11. Store baked cookies in a sealed container.
