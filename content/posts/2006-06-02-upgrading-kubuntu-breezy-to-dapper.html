title: Upgrading Kubuntu Breezy to Dapper
---
<p>Upon hearing about <a href="http://kubuntu.org/announcements/6.06-lts-release.php">yesterday's release of Kubuntu 6.06</a>, I decided to upgrade from the previous release, Kubuntu 5.10. I'd like to say that it went off without a hitch, but it didn't. It did, however, go mostly well, and I realized that my problem was that I continued to use applications while Adept installed the new packages. I couldn't install all the packages, and I ended up with a minorly disfunctional kernel that wouldn't allow <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/">ndiswrapper</a> to load properly, preventing me from using my internal wireless card. Once I rebooted (and used a spare PCMCIA wireless card to gain connectivity), I was able to finish installing the rest of the packages that had not finished properly and rebooted again. Everything pretty much worked, but I'm having to tweak some lost settings, most notably in KMail. Other than that, it's been working out fine!</p>
