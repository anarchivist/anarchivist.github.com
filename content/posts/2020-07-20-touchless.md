> The Touchless.Design project is under development to create tools and techniques to aid in the creation of safe, touchless interactive exhibits. Touchless.Design will host a collection of open-source software, design approaches, hardware information, and other resources. These resources will be freely available to museums, libraries, cultural organizations, and other public institutions.
