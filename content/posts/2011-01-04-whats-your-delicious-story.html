title: What's Your Delicious Story?
---
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've added a <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-or-did-you-use-Delicious-beyond-bookmarking-Whats-your-Delicious-story">question on Quora</a> about this too - feel free to contribute your story there.</p>
<p>In my <a href="/2010/delicious-and-the-preservation-of-platforms/">last post</a>, I talked a bit about the notion of Delicious being a platform with a myriad of uses, and I've been actively wondering about this since then. Upon further reflection, I've realized that the best way to figure this out is actually to engage and ask people directly.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I'm <em>asking for your help</em>. Of course it's upsetting that Delicious is being sunsetted, but other than individual users and <a href="http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Delicious">Archive Team</a>, people seem to be doing very little about it. Delicious is clearly more than the bookmarks. I want to gather information about how people like you and me actually used it beyond it's obvious functionality. Did you use it to manage resources for your dissertation? Did you use it to communicate with family about a serious event or illness? How did you go beyond the boundaries of it being just "about bookmarks"? How did it make you think about how you organize your information environment? I want personal stories that talk about what you may lose, however intangible it might seem, when Delicious eventually shuts down.</p>
<p>Beyond this, I want to use this information positively. I want to help share your stories. I'm hoping to do this in the form of more blog posts, or potentially even a journal article or conference presentation. Of course, I need your permission to share your story, but I'm willing even to hear how you've used it even if you would prefer it not to be discussed, cited, or quoted publicly.</p>
<p>To share your story, you have a number of options. You may, of course, leave a comment on this post. If you have your own blog or website, feel free to make a post there and then link it in a comment and send a trackback to my blog. Make a YouTube video (which I have, see below!) or a Flickr set. Tweet it. Use the tag <strong>#mydeliciousstory</strong> on whatever social media or Web 2.0 platform you prefer. Or... you can do it the old fashioned way and send me a personal email to <strong>delicious at thesecretmirror dot com</strong>. If possible, please let me know if you're willing to answer further questions, and if you're using email please specify the equivalent "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism_sourcing#.22Speaking_terms.22">speaking terms</a>" under which you're sending your message.</p>
<p>To get the ball rolling, I've made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELCcseEdsPY">YouTube video describing how I used Delicious while at NYPL</a>. It's kind of lame, but you have to get started somewhere.</p>
