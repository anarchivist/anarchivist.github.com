title: DigitalNZ and Brooklyn Museum API Modules for Python
---
<p>I've been busy the last few weeks, so I didn't even really announce this to begin with! I've been playing around with some of the cultural heritage APIs that are available, some of which I learned about while I was at <a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2009/">Museums and the Web 2009</a>. While I was away I released code for a Python module for interacting with the <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/">Brooklyn Museum Collections API</a>. After chatting with Virginia Gow from <a href="http://digitalnz.org/">DigitalNZ</a>, I also got motivated to write a Python module to interact with the <a href="http://digitalnz.org/developer">DigitalNZ API</a>. The code for both is fairly unpolished, but I'm always ready for feedback! Both modules are available as Mercurial repositories linked from <a href="http://bitbucket.org/anarchivist/">my Bitbucket account</a>. There's also a small cluster of us working on a <a href="http://museum-api.pbworks.com/">museum API wiki</a> to begin sorting out some of these issues. Comparably speaking, the library and archives world has it somewhat easy...</p>
