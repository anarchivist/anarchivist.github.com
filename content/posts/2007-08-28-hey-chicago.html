title: Hey Chicago
---
<p>I'm in the Windy City for <a href="http://archivists.org/conference/chicago2007/">SAA2007</a>. I'll be pretty busy the first few days in town, but remember, if you want to find me, just <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/anarchivist/512169236/">look for the glasses</a>. Also, make sure you come to the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/saa2007/index.php/Description_Section_Meeting">Description Section meeting</a> and <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/saa2007/index.php/Session:_Rethinking_Access_and_Descriptive_Practice_%28Session_503%29">Session 503</a> on Friday!</p>
