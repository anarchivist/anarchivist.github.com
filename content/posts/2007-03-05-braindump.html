<p>I'm really behind on posting, and I apologize. There are a few action items that I should mention before I clear my brain to allow me to start posting things with actual content.</p>
<ul>
<li>ArchivesBlogs moved, but mail to archivesblogs.com was not working for a while. A few people mentioned this to me, but I didn't get this resolved until just last week.</li>
<li>After who knows how many attempts trying to get something posted on <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a>, I finally made it when I had more information about the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/21/new_record_for_world.html">hottest chili peppers in the world</a>.</li>
<li>I now have a food blog, so if you're interested, check it out. It's called <a href="http://hungryghost.wordpress.com/">Feeding the Hungry Ghost</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that that stuff is out of the way, I can start posting about "important" things again, like my trip to Georgia for <a href="http://code4lib.org/2007">code4lib 2007</a>.</p>
