title: ICA Releases International Standard for Describing Functions
---
<p>The <a href="http://www.ica.org/"><abbr title="International Council on Archives">ICA</abbr></a>'s Committee of Best Practices and Standards released the first edition of the <a href="http://www.ica.org/en/node/38665">International Standard for Describing Functions</a> (ISDF). Like much of ICA's other work in descriptive standards for archives, ISDF is designed to be used in conjunction with established standards such as <a href="http://www.ica.org/en/node/30000"><abbr title="General International Standard for Archival Description">ISAD(G)</abbr></a> and <a href="http://www.ica.org/en/node/30004"><abbr title="International Standard for Archival Authority Records for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families">ISAAR(CPF)</abbr></a>, as well as standards in preparation such as <a href="http://www.ica.org/en/2007/10/24/cbps-international-standards-institutions-archival-holdings-isiah-call-comments"><abbr title="International Standard for Institutions with Archival Holdings">ISIAH</abbr></a>. ISDF will assist both archivists and users to understand the contextual aspects of the creation of records of corporate bodies. Through ISDF and related standards, archivists will be able to develop improved descriptive systems that can be potentially implemented using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data">Linked Data</a> model.</p>
