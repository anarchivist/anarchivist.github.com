title: 'ArchivesBlogs update: service links'
---
<p>I've upgraded Plagger (the software behind <a href="http://archivesblogs.com/">ArchivesBlogs</a>) to the latest version and it's allowed me to add service links to del.icio.us, unalog, digg, Reddit, and Technorati. I suppose I could add more (ma.gnolia, Furl, etc.), but I'll hold off doing that for the sake of cluttering the interface for the time being. If you have any service links you'd like to see, let me know and I might be able to hack something together.</p>
