title: 'ArchivesBlogs news: Disappearing Blogspot Blogs'
---
<p><a href="http://archivesblogs.com/">ArchivesBlogs</a> has been going strong for over a week now. If you use Blogspot and had a blog previously syndicated by ArchivesBlogs, your content may be temporarily unsyndicated. The specific problem is HTTP 502 error, which seems to indicate a problem with a proxy server at Blogspot. In any rate, they should return soon enough -- it would be nice to have the 9 blogs back!</p>
