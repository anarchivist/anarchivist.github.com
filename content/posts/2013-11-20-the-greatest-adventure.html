<p>With apologies to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-_r1Npsv5I">Rankin/Bass and Glenn Yarbrough</a>, the greatest adventure is what lies ahead. After almost four great years working for Manuscripts and Archives at the Yale University Library and two and a half rewarding years as the Technical Architect on ArchivesSpace, I am excited to announce that I&#8217;ve accepted a position as the <strong>Director of Technology</strong> for the <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a>, a small but well-supported non-profit dedicated to free and open access to cultural heritage materials. More information about my new position can be found in the <a href="http://dp.la/info/2013/11/20/dt-announcement/">press release</a>.</p>

<p>While I am sad to be leaving a great institution and a great project, both with fantastic colleagues, I look forward to contributing my time, energy and expertise to the addressing the huge challenges and encouraging the exciting possibilities of DPLA. If you&#8217;d like to join me in this adventure, I&#8217;m also happy to announce that DPLA will be <a href="http://dp.la/info/2013/08/20/opportunity-tech-specialist/">hiring two Technology Specialists</a> very soon, so if you&#8217;re interested or have any questions, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me!</p>
