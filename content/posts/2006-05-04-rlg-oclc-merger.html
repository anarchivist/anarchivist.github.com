<p>The technical services world has been in an uproar lately, between <a href="http://loc.gov/">LC</a>'s <a href="http://catalogablog.blogspot.com/2006/04/series-authority-records.html">decision</a> to <a href="http://libraryjuicepress.com/blog/?p=45">stop creating series authority records</a> (particularly since they didn't consult PCC members beforehand) and the <a href="http://www.guild2910.org/AFSCMECalhounReviewREV.pdf">fallout</a> after <a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/calhoun-report-final.pdf">Calhoun report</a>. We might as well have another drink, because as <a href="http://www.librarian.net/stax/1735">librarian.net reports</a> (along with several others), <a href="http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/200618.htm">OCLC</a> and <a href="http://www.rlg.org/en/page.php?Page_ID=20942">RLG</a> are about to merge. It's mindblowing to think that <a href="http://walt.lishost.org/?p=306">RLG</a> <a href="http://hangingtogether.org/?p=115">employees</a> did not find out any sooner than the rest of us, and that either organization has yet to consult its members. However, RLG plans to do so, but it will be interesting to see how this pans out. In particular, some folks worried about the merging of data and the future of <a href="http://www.redlightgreen.org/">RedLightGreen</a>. I know it's not considerably better, but they seem to be overlooking <a href="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/open/">Open WorldCat</a>.</p>
