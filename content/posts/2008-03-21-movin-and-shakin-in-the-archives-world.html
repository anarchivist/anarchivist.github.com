title: Movin' and shakin' in the archives world
---
<p><a href="http://www.archivesnext.com/">ArchivesNext</a> <a href="http://www.archivesnext.com/?p=123">recently discussed</a> <em>Library Journal</em>'s annual list of "<a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/toc-archive/2008/20080315.html?section=Movers+%26%+Shakers">Movers and Shakers</a>," pondering what a comparable list in the archival profession would look like. For those who don't know, the list recognizes "library advocates, community builders, 2.0 gurus, innovators, marketers, mentors, and problem solvers transforming libraries." After some rumination, ArchivesNext is now <a href="http://www.archivesnext.com/?page_id=124">calling for nominations</a> to generate a similar list. Do your civic duty and nominate either a project, an individual, or even a situation worthy of this recognition!</p>
