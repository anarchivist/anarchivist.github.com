title: Tomato "Foam"?
---
<p>I know, I know - you're probably thinking "foams are so over," regardless which side of the <a href="http://www.khymos.org/">molecular gastronomy</a> fence you sit on. If you're a fan of the strange powders and physical state changes of food, you might be saying "C'mon, everybody knows that espuma is the new foam!" Yeah, right - and aire is the new espuma. They're all pretty much the same thing, and you've got to be bullshitting yourself if you think that <a href="http://www.starchefs.com/events/studio/techniques/FAdria/bio_f_adria.shtml">Adri√†</a> and his ilk don't know this already. If you're convinced that all this stuff is mumbo jumbo designed to take away from traditional technique, then fine. I don't particularly care either way. I made a foam that wasn't really a foam ... or was it?</p>
<p>I was bored tonight when I was about to make supper for myself. Yesterday I got a whole bunch of free samples from <a href="http://www.foodinnovation.com/">National Starch</a>, but I haven't <em>really</em> been able to do anything with them since I've left them sitting in my office. (I did try to mix some tapioca maltodextrin with some yogurt at my desk and I ended up making a small mess. Oops.) So there I was, getting hungry, when I decided to make myself some baked eggs to put on a sandwich. "What else should I put on it?" I thought. A few tomatoes sat in a bowl, teetering on the brink of potential rottenness. They glared up at me in desperation. Feeling their need for my mercy, I decided to make some sort of sauce to go on the sandwich. I needed to practice my blanch-shock-peel technique anyhow.</p>
<p>After giving the tomatoes their spa treatment, I put them in a container with a little oil and some salt and ground chipotle and swirled it around using my immersion blender. The tomatoes seemed happier, if not a little lonely. I thought they could use some company, so I slowly added a little bit of flour and blended it together. Seeing bubbles start to form, I worked some more air in and added more flour ever so gradually until I got my first touch of foam. I'd done it - improvisationally, no less! It went well with the sandwich, and I had a bunch left over, so I grabbed a few things out of the refrigerator and came up with:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>"Toasted Cheese and Tomato Soup"</strong></p>
<p align="left">Using some cocktail rye that a colleague  had brought over for a dinner party I had a few weeks ago and fantastic Dubliner Cheese, I came up with a nice way to finish off the remnants. I could have used a smidgen more cheese as, somewhat surprisingly, the tomato foam really overpowered it. Not bad for something done out for boredom, huh?</p>
