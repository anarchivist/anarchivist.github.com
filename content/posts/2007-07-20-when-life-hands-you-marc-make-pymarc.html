title: When Life Hands You MARC, make pymarc
---
<p>It's a bad pun, but what can you expect from someone who neglects his blogs as much as I do?</p>
<p>I've been busy, somewhat, and one of my latest forays has been getting a grip on <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, an absolutely wonderful programming language. I actually enjoy writing code again, which is more than a bit scary. I was sick of the mangled scripts and workflows I came up with at MPOW to handle converting MARC data to HTML and other such nonsense. Writing Perl made me feel unclean.</p>
<p>After playing around with <a href="http://inkdroid.org/">Ed Summers</a>' <a href="http://textualize.com/pymarc">pymarc</a> module, I began hacking about and putting my own hooks into the code here and there. I longed for MARC8 to Unicode conversion, which is a necessary evil. Digging around, I came across <a href="http://www.panix.com/~asl2/">Aaron Lav</a>'s <a href="http://www.panix.com/~asl2/software/PyZ3950/">PyZ3950</a> module, which had its own little MARC code. After bugging Ed via <a href="http://code4lib.org/irc">#code4lib</a>, and hassling Aaron in the process, Ed began incorporating the code and I started some testing. Just a short while later, the conversion code worked. I bugged Ed some more telling him about some changes I made, and he gave me the chance to contribute code directly.</p>
<p>I'm no expert, but I'm glad that I could help bring pymarc <a href="http://www.inkdroid.org/journal/2007/07/20/pymarc-marc8/">up to version 1.0</a> and that I've had a chance to begin enjoy programming again. I'm also glad to see that <a href="http://catalogablog.blogspot.com/">Catalogablog </a>has <a href="http://catalogablog.blogspot.com/2007/07/pymarc.html">spread the word</a>. Download a copy and start hacking; maybe you'll be rewarded with rediscovering the joy of code like I was.</p>
