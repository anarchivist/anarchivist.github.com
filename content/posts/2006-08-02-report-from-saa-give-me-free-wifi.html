title: 'Report from SAA: Give Me Free WiFi'
---
<p>I'm at the Hilton Washington, the site of the SAA conference. I've registered and picked up my free totebag. I, and others, have bemoaned the lack of connectivity in the conference area. Wireless is only available in the lobby, so it seems, and it's rather pricy ($5.95 for 4 hours or $9.95 for 24 hours). I know archivists are often thought of as being technologically behind  (whether we are is a Pandora's box that I won't open in this post), but I  feel that some sort of net access is necessary at every conference. I'm just barely able to get it through my cell phone, which is how I'm posting now. Unfortunately, I get no reception on the conference floor so I needed to make my way up to the lobby anyhow.</p>
<p>I missed the Standards Committee meeting since  I was a little late and I didn't want to barge in since the doors were closed. It's nearly time for the Archival Solidarity session, which sounds interesting to me since I'd like to get involved in ICA. I'm trying to figure out a way to get to their university and research symposium this September in Reykjavik since I'd love to go back.</p>
