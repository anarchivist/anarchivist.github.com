A running list of things I want to do or have done. A lot of this relates to adopting the [IndieWeb](https://indiewebcamp.com/) ethos

* **DONE** ~~Enable sending and receiving webmentions~~
* **DONE** ~~Minimal h-entry markup~~
* New theme!
* Enable incoming [webmention](https://indiewebcamp.com/webmention) displays from [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/).
* Redo build process, perhaps running on [Travis](http://travis-ci.com/) or my own server.
* Enable automatic <abbr title="Publish on my Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere">[POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE)</abbr> to Twitter, Medium, Slideshare, LinkedIn, and Facebook(?). Consider using [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/about) if this will lower friction.
* Send automatic webmentions through Webmention.io on build.
* Mobile post creation and editing using an existing Git client and Markdown editor.
* Adopt [Micropub](https://indiewebcamp.com/micropub) or something comparable to potentially stage posts through pull requests. Longer term goal is to have a nice mobile client.
* Refactor the publication and resume to be data driven.
* Reuse and refactor existing codebases, like [Aaron Gustafon's Jekyll plugin for webmentions](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/enabling-webmentions-in-jekyll/) ([Github repo](github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io)) and [Will Norris'](http://willnorris.com/) [syndication plugin](https://github.com/willnorris/willnorris.com/blob/master/src/_plugins/syndication.rb).
* Implement [Jekyll collections](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) as a proxy for managing [h-entry](http://indiewebcamp.com/h-entry) post-types.
* Cache and eventually move commenting away from Disqus.
