I'm trying to do a better job tracking what I've been reading. Here's a start.

**Key:** ✅ finished; 👍🏽 recommended; 🤯 blew my mind; 🔀 non-linear reading; 😒 meh  

* Cynthia Cruz, _Disquieting: Essays on Silence_ (Book*hug, 2019) ✅👍🏽🤯
* Margarita García Robayo, _Fish Soup_ (Charco Press, 2018, tr. Charlotte Coombe) 😒
* _The Desert Fathers: Sayings of the Early Christian Monks_ (Penguin Books, 2003, tr. Benedicta Ward) 🔀🤯
* Jenny Odell, _How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy_ (Melville House, 2019) ✅👍🏽
* Elinor Ostrom, _Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action_ (Cambridge UP, 1990)
