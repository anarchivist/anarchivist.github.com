[RightsStatements.org](https://rightsstatements.org/) is a consortial initiative that focuses on providing a set of interoperable rights statements that make it easier for people to engage and reuse digital cultural heritage, particularly when provided by metadata aggregators. Since 2014, I have served as the co-chair of the Consortium's Technical Working Group, which is responsible for maintaining the initiative's vocabulary and infrastructure. We maintain our projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/rightsstatements).<!--more-->
