## AIMS ("Born Digital Collections: An Inter-Institutional Model for Stewardship (AIMS)")

An Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-funded project, with University of Virginia, Yale University, Stanford University, and University of Hull collaborating on an inter-institutional framework for stewarding electronic records in collecting repositories.
