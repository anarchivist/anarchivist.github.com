<p>I'm going to be on the latest installment of the <a href="http://www.socketscdr.com/">SocketsCDR</a> audio zine, curated this time around by Rebecca Mills of <a href="http://www.thecautioncurves.com/">The Caution Curves</a>. Sean, the SocketsCDR label honcho, just posted the <a href="http://static.flickr.com/46/193026057_8433729eeb_b.jpg">cover artwork</a> for it and it looks like a great line-up, including friends like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/plumsband">The Plums</a> and <a href="http://www.stamenandpistils.com/">Stamen &amp; Pistils</a>. This will be my first release in a while (other than the collab CD with myself, Cotton Museum, and Actual Birds on <a href="http://www.casanovatemptations.net/">Casanova Temptations</a>). More details will follow, naturally.</p>
