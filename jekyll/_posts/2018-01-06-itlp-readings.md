I completed my reading and viewing assignments for my cohort's <span class="h-event">__IT Leadership Program Workshop 1__{:.p-name} (<time class="dt-start" datetime="2017-01-09">January 9</time>-<time class="dt-start" datetime="2017-01-11">January 11</time> at <span class="p-location">UC Berkeley</span>.) This is a brief set of notes for my own use about how all of them tie together. <!--more-->

* Leaders are made not born and leadership skills don't always transfer across contexts.  
* Leadership should be reflected in the culture of the organization; developing leaders, even in medium- and lower-level employees is a key part of that. Encourage them to take this on, and protect them when they step up. Leading up (i.e., leading your boss) should be expected, too.
* Be aware of where you are looking to anticipate change.
* Don't be head down; you need to retain focus both of the work around you and broader context. You are responsible for framing problems, not solving them exclusively.  
* Great leaders have diverse networks and the ability to develop relationships with people different from them.
* Self-mastery is the key to leadership. Great leaders model behavior (poise; emotional capacity) and define direction. Retaining empathy, humanity, dignity, passion, connection to other people in environment of transactional interaction are all hard.
* Conflict and feeling pressure is necessary. Don't smooth over either too much; instead, regulate it.
* Be willing to look at taking large leaps, but take the time to understand them. At the same time, don't wed yourself to long-term strategic planning processes that might be blocks.
* Inspire people to move beyond their own perceived limitations and encourage others to break with convention when necessary.
