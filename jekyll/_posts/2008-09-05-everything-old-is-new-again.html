<p>Goodbye, WordPress - I've been drinking more of the KoolAid. I rebuilt my <a href="/">personal/professional site</a> (not this blog) in <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. Migrating the content was pretty easy (about 15 static pages, no posts). The functionality is astounding - I only started working on redoing it yesterday and I've already got a great infrastructure. Expect a detailed post before too long, or at least a link to a colophon on said site.</p>
