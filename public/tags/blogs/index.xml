      <description>When Mark asked me to write about our use of Drupal at the Dickinson College Archives and Special Collections, the first thing I thought about was when our Archives Reference Blog was initially launched in April 2007.

Jessamyn West of librarian.net interviewed me for an article (&#34;Saving Digital History&#34;) in Library Journal netConnect.

      <description>I won&#39;t bother waiting to be tagged to do this, because all the cool kids already are. I read too many blogs already, so here we go.
 Mary Eats is, as one would easily assume, a blog about food. Mary started the blog while she and her husband were living in Korea, and thus there&#39;s an overwhelming emphasis on Korean food and restaurants. She moved to Seattle relatively recently and began culinary school, too.</description>
