      <description>As you may have heard, the National Archives issued a press release today announcing the release of three data sets on Data.gov:
The first milestone of the Open Government Directive was met on January 22 with the release of new datasets on Data.gov. Each major government agency has uploaded at least three datasets in this initial action. The National Archives released the 2007â€”2009 Code of Federal Regulations and two datasets from its Archival Research Catalog.</description>

So, it&#39;s time for another rant about my issues with EAD. This one is a pretty straightforward and short one, and comes down to the issue that I should essentially be able to mix and match metadata schemas. This is not a new idea, and I&#39;m tired of the archives community treating it like it is one. Application profiles, as they are called, allow us to define a structured way to combine elements from different schemas, prevent addition of new and arbitrary elements, and tighten existing standards for particular use cases.</description>

Man, if this isn&#39;t a &#34;you got your peanut butter in my chocolate thing&#34; or what! As I wrote over on the NYPL Labs blog, we&#39;ve been up to our necks in Drupal at MPOW, and I&#39;ve found that one of the great advantages of using it is rapid prototyping without having to write a whole lot of code. Again, that&#39;s how I feel about Python, too, but you knew that already.</description>
