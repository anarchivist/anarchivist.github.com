      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hyku.samvera.org/&#34;&gt;Hyku&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Hydra in a Box, is a next-generation repository solution based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://samvera.org/&#34;&gt;Samvera&lt;/a&gt;. From I served as the Project Director (2015-2016), and Data Modeler (2016-2017) for the implementation partnership grant between DPLA, Stanford University, and DuraSpace, and funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Push-to-Talk Conference Call Foot Pedal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My current position at &lt;a href=&#34;https://dp.la/&#34;&gt;DPLA&lt;/a&gt;, especially since we are remote-first
organization, requires me to be on lots of conference calls, both video and audio.
While I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the value of staying muted while I&amp;rsquo;m not talking, there are a
couple of things that make this challenging. First, I usually need the window
for the call to have focus to unmute myself by the platform&amp;rsquo;s designated keystroke.
Forget that working well if you need to bring something up in another window,
or switch to another application. Secondly, while we have our own preferred
platform internally (Google Hangouts), I have to use countless others, too;
each of those platforms has its own separate keystroke to mute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all leads to a less than ideal situation, and naturally, I figured there
must be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archivesspace.org&#34;&gt;ArchivesSpace&lt;/a&gt; is an open source archival management system. During the project&amp;rsquo;s grant-funded phases in 2010-2013, I worked as a technical consultant during the planning phase, and as Technical Architect and product owner during the implementation phase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
