      <description>The moderated discussion hosted and sponsored by Nylink went pretty well. Also, I don&#39;t need the records to have fun with the data &#34;‚Äù I just need robust APIs. (In fact, as I said today, I&#39;d prefer not to have to deal with the MARC records directly.) Robust APIs would help making prototypes like this one I hacked together in a few hours into a real, usable service.</description>
