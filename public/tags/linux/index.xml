      <description>While I fully intend to go over my full experience upgrading to the latest development release of Kubuntu, one of the things that I first noticed was that Privoxy didn&#39;t seem to work or to be speaking with Tor, preventing me from that lovely &#34;anonymous&#34; browsing experience. I noticed that in the upgrade the ever important &#34;forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .&#34; line in /etc/privoxy/config wasn&#39;t in the upgraded version (actually, it shouldn&#39;t be).</description>

      <description>Upon hearing about yesterday&#39;s release of Kubuntu 6.06, I decided to upgrade from the previous release, Kubuntu 5.10. I&#39;d like to say that it went off without a hitch, but it didn&#39;t. It did, however, go mostly well, and I realized that my problem was that I continued to use applications while Adept installed the new packages. I couldn&#39;t install all the packages, and I ended up with a minorly disfunctional kernel that wouldn&#39;t allow ndiswrapper to load properly, preventing me from using my internal wireless card.</description>
