&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, we officially announced &lt;a href=&#34;http://dp.la/info/2015/02/11/dpla-releases-krikri-0-1-3/&#34;&gt;the initial release of Krikri&lt;/a&gt;, our new metadata aggregation, mapping, and enrichment toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of its importance, we would like to take a moment for a more informal introduction to the newest members of DPLA’s herd. Krikri and Heiðrún (a.k.a. Heidrun; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forvo.com/word/hei%C3%B0r%C3%BAn/&#34;&gt;pronounced like &lt;i&gt;hey-droon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are key to many of DPLA’s plans and serve as a critical piece of infrastructure for DPLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also names for, or types, of goats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post has been crossposted to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/archives/7938&#34;&gt;Digital Library Federation blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code4lib.org/conference/2015&#34;&gt;Code4lib 2015&lt;/a&gt; was held last week from February 9-12, 2015 in Portland, Oregon. The Code4lib conferences have grown in the last ten years, both in terms of size and scope of topics. This growth is particularly impressive when you consider that much of the work of organizing the conference falls upon a circulating group of volunteers, with additional organizational support from organizations like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/&#34;&gt;Digital Library Federation&lt;/a&gt;. It has become clear to me that the Code4lib community is interested in ensuring that it can develop and support compelling and useful conferences for everyone who chooses to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, DPLA is committed to making cultural heritage materials held in America&#39;s libraries, archives, and museums freely available to all, and we provide &lt;a href=&#34;http://dp.la/info/developers/&#34;&gt;maximally open data&lt;/a&gt; to encourage transformative uses of those materials by developers. In addition, DPLA is also proud to distribute the software we produce to support our mission to the wider community.</description>

      <description>Clifford Lynch, Executive Director of the Coalition for Networked Information, has responded to the leaked SirsiDynix report that spreads horrific untruths about open source. Marshall Breeding posted Lynch&#39;s response on GuidePosts. In particular, Lynch notes the following:
I don&#39;t think that I ever wrote those words down in an article; I suppose I may have said something to that effect in an interview or q&amp;amp;a in some conference program like ALA Top Tech, though perhaps no quite as strongly as it&#39;s expressed here.</description>

      <title>SirsiDynix Report Leaked, Spreading Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt about Open Source</title>

      <description>Thanks to Twitter, I discovered that Wikileaks has posted a report written by SirsiDynix Vice President for Innovation StephenAbram which spreads a fantastic amount of fear, uncertainty and doubt about both open source software in general and, more specifically, the suitability of open source integrated library systems. As the summary provided by Wikileaks states,
This document was released only to a select number of existing customers of the company SirsiDynix, a proprietary library automation software vendor.</description>

      <title>Python WorldCat API module now available</title>
      <link>https://matienzo.org/2008/python-worldcat-api-module-now-available/</link>

      <guid>https://matienzo.org/2008/python-worldcat-api-module-now-available/</guid>
      <description>I&#39;d like to humbly announce that I&#39;ve written a pre-pre-alpha Python module for working with the WorldCat Search API and the xID APIs. The code needs a fair amount of work, namely unit tests and documentation. I&#39;ve released the code under the GPL.
The module, called &#34;worldcat&#34;, is available from the Python Package Index. You can also checkout a copy of the code from my Subversion repository.</description>
