      <description>I&#39;m really looking forward to next week&#39;s code4lib conference in Providence, despite my utter failure to complete or implement the project on which I am presenting. In particular, I&#39;m really looking forward to the linked data preconference. Like some of my other fellow attendees, I&#39;ve hammered out a FOAF file for the preconference already so that Ed Summers&#39; combo FOAF crawler and attendee info web app.

This is what the sample output looks using my FOAF data.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve had my hands full lately. Two weeks ago I was at the MCN conference (wherein, among other things, I have continued my dominion as Archduke of Archival Description by taking over the MCN Standards SIG chair position from The Bancroft Library&#39;s Mary Elings), and next week I&#39;m off to Philadelphia for the PACSCL Something New for Something Old conference. I hammered out the coherent, written version of my paper I gave at EAD@10.</description>
