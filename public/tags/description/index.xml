      <description>As you may have heard, the National Archives issued a press release today announcing the release of three data sets on Data.gov:
The first milestone of the Open Government Directive was met on January 22 with the release of new datasets on Data.gov. Each major government agency has uploaded at least three datasets in this initial action. The National Archives released the 2007â€”2009 Code of Federal Regulations and two datasets from its Archival Research Catalog.</description>

      <title>Access and Description Reconsidered</title>

      <description>What exactly is archival access, and how does archival description make it possible? I feel like that in some form or another I&#39;ve been struggling with this question throughout my career. Recently, this blog post from The Top Shelf, the blog of the University of Texas at San Antonio Archives and Special Collections Department, came across my radar, wherein they write (emphasis in original):
UTSA Archives and Special Collections is among the growing number of archives to create an online presence for every one of its collections.</description>

      <title>Must Contextual Description Be Bound To Records Description?</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been struggling with the fact that (American) archival practice seems to bind contextual description (i.e., description of records creators) to records description. Much of these thoughts have been stirring in my head as a result of my class at Rare Book School. If we take a relatively hardline approach, e.g. the kind suggested by Chris Hurley (&#34;contextual data should be developed independently of the perceived uses to which it will be put&#34;</description>

      <description>This week in Charlottesville has been a whirlwind exploration of standards and implementation strategies thus far during my class, Designing Archival Description Systems, at Rare Book School. My classmates and I have been under the esteemed tutelage of Daniel Pitti, who has served as the technical architect for both EAD and EAC. Interestingly, there&#39;s been a whole lot of talk about linking data, linked data, and Linked Data, date normalization, and print versus online presentation, among other things.</description>

      <title>&#34;Summer Camp for Archivists&#34; Sounds So Much Better</title>

      <description>Crossposted to NYPL Labs.
I&#39;m staying with colleagues and good friends during my week-long stint in Charlottesville, Virginia for Rare Book School. If you&#39;re here - particularly if you&#39;re in my class (Daniel Pitti&#39;s Designing Archival Description Systems) - let me know. I&#39;m looking forward to a heady week dealing with descriptive standards, knowledge representation, and as always, doing my best to sell the archives world on Linked Data. Notes and thoughts will follow, as always, on here.</description>

      <title>NYART Presentation: Archives &amp;amp; The Semantic Web</title>

      <description>This last Tuesday, I spoke at the Annual Meeting of the Archivists&#39; Roundtable of Metropolitan New York, where I gave a talk on archives and the Semantic Web. The presentation went over very well, and colleagues from both the archives field and the semantic technology field were in attendance. I did my best to keep the presentation not overtly technical and cover just enough to get archivists to think about how things could be in the future.</description>

      <title>dEAD Reckoning #2: Mixing/Matching With Namespaces and Application Profiles</title>

So, it&#39;s time for another rant about my issues with EAD. This one is a pretty straightforward and short one, and comes down to the issue that I should essentially be able to mix and match metadata schemas. This is not a new idea, and I&#39;m tired of the archives community treating it like it is one. Application profiles, as they are called, allow us to define a structured way to combine elements from different schemas, prevent addition of new and arbitrary elements, and tighten existing standards for particular use cases.</description>

      <title>dEAD Reckoning #1: A FaTHEADed Failure For Faceted Terms and Headings in EAD</title>

      <description>A while back, I wrote a Bad MARC Rant, and I considered titling this a Bad Metadata Rant. However, as the kids say, I got mad beef with a little metadata standard called Encoded Archival Description. Accordingly, I figured I should begin a new series of posts discussing some of these issues that I have with something that is, for better or for worse, a technological fixture of our profession. This is in part prompted by thoughts that I&#39;ve had as a result of participating in EAD@10 and attending the Something New for Something Old conference sponsored by the PACSCL Consortial Survey Initiative.</description>

      <title>ICA Releases International Standard for Describing Functions</title>
      <link>https://matienzo.org/2008/ica-releases-international-standard-for-describing-functions/</link>

      <guid>https://matienzo.org/2008/ica-releases-international-standard-for-describing-functions/</guid>
      <description>The ICA&#39;s Committee of Best Practices and Standards released the first edition of the International Standard for Describing Functions (ISDF). Like much of ICA&#39;s other work in descriptive standards for archives, ISDF is designed to be used in conjunction with established standards such as ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF), as well as standards in preparation such as ISIAH. ISDF will assist both archivists and users to understand the contextual aspects of the creation of records of corporate bodies.</description>
