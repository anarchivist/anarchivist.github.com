      <title>Solidarity, logistics, and infrastructure on Prime Day</title>
      <link>https://matienzo.org/2019/solidarity-logistics-and-infrastructure-on-prime-day/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;July 15 and 16th are &amp;ldquo;Prime Day,&amp;rdquo; Amazon&amp;rsquo;s attempt to drive up sales and artificial demand around things we don&amp;rsquo;t need at prices they&amp;rsquo;ve convinced us that we can afford. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/histoftech&#34;&gt;Mar Hicks&lt;/a&gt;, many of us heard that workers at a Shakopee, Minnesota fulfillment center are holding a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-08/amazon-workers-plan-prime-day-strike-despite-15-an-hour-pledge&#34;&gt;six-hour work stoppage&lt;/a&gt; on one of the busiest days of the year. Alongside, many have called for a boycott on Amazon and its subsidiaries (Whole Foods, Goodreads, Twitch, etc.), and others have called for a general strike to protest &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/07/11/internal-email-amazon-faces-pressure-from-more-than-500-employees-to-cut-ties-with-palantir-for-working-with-ice/&#34;&gt;Amazon&amp;rsquo;s collaboration with Palantir in aiding ICE&lt;/a&gt;. With all of this in mind, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reflecting on what larger scale industrial actions could look like when we look at Amazon&amp;rsquo;s simultaneous leveraging of centralization and unreliability of single resources to provide critical infrastructure for the IT sector and its own operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2018: a year in gratitude</title>
      <link>https://matienzo.org/2019/2018-a-year-in-gratitude/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2019 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://matienzo.org/2019/2018-a-year-in-gratitude/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year was largely complicated and often felt like a massive garbage fire to myself and my crew. I didn&amp;rsquo;t accomplish a number of my goals and was &lt;a href=&#34;https://matienzo.org/2018/iterative-intentions-for-2018/&#34;&gt;inconsistent about others&lt;/a&gt;, so recapping awesome things I did doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel appropriate and also happens to be a soft reminder of either failure or things not going as planned. I also tend to hate &amp;ldquo;best of the year&amp;rdquo; lists but I find them helpful to remember about where I found joy or the ability to connect to something outside of myself. I suppose this is an attempt to reconcile those things, or perhaps more in line with the end of year spirit, a way to articulate gratitude to the people and things around me that impacted me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When basil has gone to seed: contemplative pesto</title>
      <link>https://matienzo.org/2018/when-basil-has-gone-to-seed-contemplative-pesto/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are growing three kinds of basil in our garden: &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; basil, purple basil, and Magic Mountain basil. The regular basil and Magic Mountain basil have been thriving quite a bit; the purple basil, less so, as it is growing at the base of the regular basil plant. But the other two, my goodness. The regular old basil was going to seed, though, much to the chagrin of my partner. I&amp;rsquo;d promised for weeks on end to do something with all that basil, as the stems grew woodier, and as the flowers turned from brilliant white to the brown of kraft paper. Meanwhile, the Magic Mountain basil also grew tall and bushy, went to flower, but only because that&amp;rsquo;s what it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evidence of Them: Digitization, Preservation, and Labor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a lightly edited version of the presentation I gave as part of as a part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://archives2018.sched.com/event/ESmV/507-pop-up-digitization-isnot-preservation-room-change&#34;&gt;Session 507: Digitization IS/NOT Preservation&lt;/a&gt; at the 2018 Society of American Archivists Annual Meeting. The session was overall pure fire, with thoughtful, funny, provocative, and challenging presentations by Julia Kim, Frances Harrell, Tre Berney, Andrew Robb, Snowden Becker, Fletcher Durant, Siobhan Hagan, and Sarah Werner. My heart goes out to all of them. All of the images used in the presentation were adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://theartofgooglebooks.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;The Art of Google Books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t say this lightly: participating in ITLP has been transformative for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot through the readings, workshops, and applied learning aspects, but honestly, the most valuable aspects have been individual development and participation in a leadership community. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure why these two things go hand in hand for me, but I believe that it has something to do with the support I&amp;rsquo;ve felt from all of everyone, both the instructors and cohort participants, throughout the program.</description>

      <title>Beyond hearing (one another): radical empathy in archives-as-workplace</title>
      <link>https://matienzo.org/2018/beyond-hearing-one-another-radical-empathy-in-archives-as-workplace/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing this amidst being crammed into a seat flying back from New York City, after a few days of intensive meetings. Between a number of good and less ideal things, my mind has felt really unsettled lately, and I&amp;rsquo;m working through some professional malaise, and feeling a bit rudderless. In an attempt to give myself something be myself optimistic about and to set some  direction, I reread &lt;span class=&#34;h-cite&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michellecaswell.org/&#34;&gt;Michelle Caswell&lt;/a&gt;{:.p-author .h-card} and &lt;a href=&#34;https://marikacifor.com/&#34;&gt;Marika Cifor&lt;/a&gt;{:.p-author .h-card}&amp;rsquo;s &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/time&gt; &lt;em&gt;Archivaria&lt;/em&gt;{:.p-publication} article &lt;a href=&#34;https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0mb9568h&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;From Human Rights to Feminist Ethics: Radical Empathy in Archives&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;{:.u-url .p-name}.&lt;/span&gt; Part of their analysis outlines four affective shifts in archival relationships based on radical empathy - those between 1) archivist and records creator, 2) archivist and records subject, 3) archivist and user, and 4) archivist and larger community. Given a long list of topics on my mind (precarity, developing inclusive workplaces and cultures, my own uncertain pathway), it felt like there was plenty of space to identify other shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sending WebSub notifications from static sites using Netlify functions</title>
      <link>https://matienzo.org/2018/sending-websub-notifications-from-static-sites-using-netlify-functions/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 16:33:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://matienzo.org/2018/sending-websub-notifications-from-static-sites-using-netlify-functions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://matienzo.org/2018/iterative-intentions-for-2018/&#34;&gt;iterative intentions for 2018&lt;/a&gt;, I started a project to rebuild and simplify my website. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Jekyll for quite some time (either by itself or with Octopress), and as part of the latest iteration of the site, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to align the site more with &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;Indieweb&lt;/a&gt; principles, and to smooth the deployment path for my site by hosting it on &lt;a href=&#34;https://netlify.com/&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge with Jekyll and other static site generators is that &amp;ldquo;dynamic-ish&amp;rdquo; functionality, including sending notifications through protocols like &lt;a href=&#34;https://websub.rocks/&#34;&gt;WebSub&lt;/a&gt;. The trouble is knowing where these actions fit into the build process for your site: you don&amp;rsquo;t want to send the notifications before your site gets built, or pushed to the &lt;abbr title=&#34;content delivery network&#34;&gt;CDN&lt;/abbr&gt; hosting your site. Recently, Netlify announced a private beta for its new &lt;a href=&#34;https://functions-beta--www.netlify.com/docs/lambda-functions/&#34;&gt;Netlify Functions&lt;/a&gt; service, which provides lambda-style functions deployed as part of your site deployment. One of the neat features that exists as of the beta is the ability to &lt;a href=&#34;https://functions-beta--www.netlify.com/docs/lambda-functions/#event-triggered-functions&#34;&gt;trigger the functions via Netlify events&lt;/a&gt;, like when your site successfully deploys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I completed my reading and viewing assignments for my cohort&amp;rsquo;s &lt;span class=&#34;h-event&#34;&gt;__IT Leadership Program Workshop 1__{:.p-name} (&lt;time class=&#34;dt-start&#34; datetime=&#34;2017-01-09&#34;&gt;January 9&lt;/time&gt;-&lt;time class=&#34;dt-start&#34; datetime=&#34;2017-01-11&#34;&gt;January 11&lt;/time&gt; at &lt;span class=&#34;p-location&#34;&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/span&gt;.) This is a brief set of notes for my own use about how all of them tie together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Iterative Intentions for 2018</title>

      <description>While I enjoy seeing what my friends are setting their intentions towards in the new year, I don&amp;rsquo;t really believe in new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions for myself. They tend to wear on me heavily whenever I&amp;rsquo;ve proclaimed a long list of things I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to get better at. Instead, this year, I&amp;rsquo;m starting with a very short list. My hope is that I can commit to a small number of good habits at a time, which I can then build on iteratively.</description>

      <title>A Push-to-Talk Conference Call Foot Pedal</title>
      <link>https://matienzo.org/2016/a-push-to-talk-conference-call-foot-pedal/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2016 14:16:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://matienzo.org/2016/a-push-to-talk-conference-call-foot-pedal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My current position at &lt;a href=&#34;https://dp.la/&#34;&gt;DPLA&lt;/a&gt;, especially since we are remote-first
organization, requires me to be on lots of conference calls, both video and audio.
While I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the value of staying muted while I&amp;rsquo;m not talking, there are a
couple of things that make this challenging. First, I usually need the window
for the call to have focus to unmute myself by the platform&amp;rsquo;s designated keystroke.
Forget that working well if you need to bring something up in another window,
or switch to another application. Secondly, while we have our own preferred
platform internally (Google Hangouts), I have to use countless others, too;
each of those platforms has its own separate keystroke to mute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all leads to a less than ideal situation, and naturally, I figured there
must be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How We Work: The DPLA Technology Team Core Values</title>

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects of the work of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://digitalpubliclibraryofamerica.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TECH/&#34;&gt;DPLA Technology Team&lt;/a&gt;¬†is ensuring that we maintain a common frame of reference for all of our efforts. This is situated in multiple aspects - in terms of our shared technical knowledge, the overall &lt;a href=&#34;https://dp.la/info/about/strategic-plan/&#34;&gt;DPLA strategic plan&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Overall, however, the guiding principles for our work are best understood through the core values that inform how we work together within our team, as well as with our colleagues at DPLA and across the network of our stakeholders and collaborators. These values are not only designed to be aspirational; instead, they also inform practical aspects of our day to day work, allowing us to work together effectively through their articulation of cultural norms and expectations. In addition,¬†our values encourage us to be intentional about our work, even when faced with challenges from¬†deadlines, staff capacity, and other external pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A running list of things I want to do or have done. A lot of this relates to adopting the IndieWeb ethos
 DONE Enable sending and receiving webmentions DONE Minimal h-entry markup New theme! Enable incoming webmention displays from Webmention.io. Redo build process, perhaps running on Travis or my own server. Enable automatic POSSE to Twitter, Medium, Slideshare, LinkedIn, and Facebook(?). Consider using Bridgy if this will lower friction. Send automatic webmentions through Webmention.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Within the Technical Working Group of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dp.la/info/2014/03/03/promoting-&lt;p&gt;interoperability-working-on-rights/&#34;&gt;International Rights Statements Working Group&lt;/a&gt;, we have been focusing our efforts on identifying a set of requirements and a technically sound and sustainable plan to implement the rights statements under development. Now that two of the Working Group‚Äôs white papers have been released, we realized it was a good time to build on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dp.la/info/2015/05/11/the-principles-for-establishing-international-interoperable-rights-statements/&#34;&gt;introductory blog post&lt;/a&gt; by our Co-Chairs, Emily Gore and Paul Keller. Accordingly, we hope this post provides a good introduction to our technical white paper, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/1QtmmmT&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Recommendations for the Technical Infrastructure for Standardized International Rights Statements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more generally, how our thinking has changed throughout the activities of the working group.&lt;/p&gt; </description>

      <description>This is a joint blog post by DPLAFest attendees Benjamin Armintor and Christina Harlow, and DPLA staff members Mark Matienzo and Tom Johnson.
After the passage of SEA 101 (the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act), many scheduled attendees of DPLAFest were conflicted about its location in Indianapolis. Emily Gore, DPLA Director for Content, captured both this conflict and the opportunity the location provides when she wrote:
We should want to support our hosts and the businesses in Indianapolis who are standing up against this law‚Ä¶ At DPLAfest, we will also have visible ways to show that we are against this kind of discrimination, including enshrining our values in our Code of Conduct.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, we officially announced &lt;a href=&#34;http://dp.la/info/2015/02/11/dpla-releases-krikri-0-1-3/&#34;&gt;the initial release of Krikri&lt;/a&gt;, our new metadata aggregation, mapping, and enrichment toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of its importance, we would like to take a moment for a more informal introduction to the newest members of DPLA‚Äôs herd. Krikri and Hei√∞r√∫n (a.k.a. Heidrun; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forvo.com/word/hei%C3%B0r%C3%BAn/&#34;&gt;pronounced like &lt;i&gt;hey-droon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are key to many of DPLA‚Äôs plans and serve as a critical piece of infrastructure for DPLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also names for, or types, of goats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post has been crossposted to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/archives/7938&#34;&gt;Digital Library Federation blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code4lib.org/conference/2015&#34;&gt;Code4lib 2015&lt;/a&gt; was held last week from February 9-12, 2015 in Portland, Oregon. The Code4lib conferences have grown in the last ten years, both in terms of size and scope of topics. This growth is particularly impressive when you consider that much of the work of organizing the conference falls upon a circulating group of volunteers, with additional organizational support from organizations like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/&#34;&gt;Digital Library Federation&lt;/a&gt;. It has become clear to me that the Code4lib community is interested in ensuring that it can develop and support compelling and useful conferences for everyone who chooses to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>With apologies to Rankin/Bass and Glenn Yarbrough, the greatest adventure is what lies ahead. After almost four great years working for Manuscripts and Archives at the Yale University Library and two and a half rewarding years as the Technical Architect on ArchivesSpace, I am excited to announce that I&amp;#8217;ve accepted a position as the Director of Technology for the Digital Public Library of America, a small but well-supported non-profit dedicated to free and open access to cultural heritage materials.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I wrote about wanting to address issues of privilege in the space between archives and technology. As a first step, I mentioned organizing a New York group of Computer Anonymous. I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve scheduled our first meeting:
Tuesday, October 29, 2013, 6:30 PM - ?, at Pacific Standard, 82 Fourth Avenue, Brooklyn, NY
We have about seven people who have indicated that they&amp;rsquo;re planning on attending.</description>

      <description>Like others, I found the presidential address of Jackie Dooley last August&amp;rsquo;s Society of American Archivists annual meeting to be problematic. At the time, I had little more to add than what was articulated by others, such as Sam Winn&amp;rsquo;s post on professional privilege. As the dust settles, though I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot more clarity.
The Society of American Archivists is not really an easy place to examine our privilege or our struggle.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some, the phrase &amp;ldquo;born digital resources&amp;rdquo; may be unfamiliar, but Ricky Erway, Senior Program Officer at OCLC Research wrote a brief essay entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/activities/hiddencollections/borndigital.pdf?urlm=161291&#34;&gt;Defining &amp;ldquo;Born Digital&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a handy, working definition: &amp;ldquo;items created and managed in digital form.&amp;rdquo; Manuscripts and Archives, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, and Yale University Library overall have had a notable history of working with born digital resources over the past ten years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emotion, Archives, Interactive Fiction, and Linked Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Edit (Feb 24, 2013):&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to the fantastic work of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tararobertson.ca&#34;&gt;Tara Robertson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://archive.org/details/Day4LTMark&#34;&gt;video of my lightning talk&lt;/a&gt; is now available!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a lightning talk entitled [&amp;ldquo;Wielding the Whip: Affect, Archives, and Ontological Fusion&amp;rdquo;]({{ root_url }}/storage/2013/2013Feb-code4lib-lightning-talk) at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code4lib.org/conference/2013&#34;&gt;2013 Code4lib conference&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago, Illinois. This lightning talk was one of the most difficult presentations I&amp;rsquo;ve ever given for a number of reasons, including the emotional aspect of the content itself, as well as the fact that several of the ideas I was trying to articulate weren&amp;rsquo;t fully baked. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this for the four to six months in various capacities and with different focuses, especially as I read more interactive fiction and learn more about it (as well as about hypertext in general). This post serves as an expansion of some of the ideas in my lightning talk and as a way to further the discussion around the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we write interactive fiction and (semi-/para-)fictional hypertext that leverages linked data to create an emotional connection to the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Thursday, October 6 was the Day of Digital Archives, organized by friend and colleague Gretchen Gueguen at the University of Virginia. I missed the post deadline yesterday, but it&#39;s been a busy week, so I might as well walk through some of the highlights of my work related to digital archives that occurred during that 24 hours from 12 am Thursday to 12 am Friday.
12 AM: It&#39;s late, but I&#39;m finishing the last bit of work of writing up lecture notes.</description>

It can be a seemingly scary (and potentially lonely) experience if it&#39;s your first conference, and we archivists are not always known for our extrovertedness. So, without further ado, here is my brief list of suggestions - again, some of which have been shamelessly &lt;del&gt;stolen&lt;/del&gt;¬†adapted from Declan&#39;s guide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Thanks to the great work of Lance (@newmsi), Rachel Donahue (@sheepeeh), and Angelique Richardson (@RandomArchivist) last year, the first SAA Tweetup was pulled off successfully in Washington, DC. Given that this year&#39;s SAA Annual Meeting is just a few weeks away, Hillel Arnold (@helrond) and I have elected to organize one in Chicago, as well.
We&#39;re holding this year&#39;s Tweetup on Thursday, August 25, starting at 9 PM, at the Clark Street Ale House, which is about a mile from the conference hotel and easily walkable and accessible by public transportation.</description>

      <description>Some of us archivists have growing concerns regarding the long-standing labor dispute between UNITE HERE Local 1 and the management of the Hyatt Regency Chicago, the location of the 2011 Annual Meeting of the Society of American Archivists. Most recently, this labor dispute has led to a one-day strike of housekeepers, dishwashers, bellmen and other hotel workers¬†on June 20, 2011.
SAA has not given its membership any guidance to its membership about how to support UNITE HERE Local 1 and the Hyatt&#39;s hotel workers.</description>

      <description>I have spent the last several months in a fog. Emotions tend to get the better of me whenever faced with a barrier in my work life. It&#39;s gotten increasingly difficult for me to see the forest for the trees, no matter how much I tell myself that my work is for the greater good of my unit, my institution, and archivy. Self-doubt creeps in, as does stress, frustration, depression. Positivity begins to wane, with optimism replaced by apathy and sarcasm.</description>

      <description>I am sad to announce the passing of Robert L. &#34;Bob&#34; Frost (1952-2011). Bob was an associate professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, my alma mater, where he had taught since 2000. Bob had been battling cancer for over two years. Ed Vielmetti has written an obituary of Bob on his blog, including the announcement from SI Dean Jeffrey Mackie-Mason.
Bob was an inspiration to many of us SI alums, and his magnetic personality, sharp wit, and joie de vivre ensured he had a bevy of his students and colleagues buzzing around him at any given time.</description>

In my last post, I talked a bit about the notion of Delicious being a platform with a myriad of uses, and I&#39;ve been actively wondering about this since then. Upon further reflection, I&#39;ve realized that the best way to figure this out is actually to engage and ask people directly.
Accordingly, I&#39;m asking for your help.</description>

      <description>Just as plenty of others have, I recoiled in horror when I heard that Delicious (n√©e del.icio.us) was being &#34;sunsetted&#34;. Regardless of the red flags that have been raised about its potentially imminent demise, I&#39;ve still been using it on a daily basis. I&#39;ve been an active user for over 6.5 years, which is longer than I can say for just about any other web platform or service. I deleted my Friendster and Myspace accounts quite a while ago; I&#39;ve been on Flickr almost as long as Delicious, but the bookmarking wins out by a good four months or so.</description>

      <description>Earlier today I&#39;d posted about the Australian Society of Archivists&#39; announcement about the Aus-Archivists listserv being &#34;lost.&#34; Tim Sherratt, an Australian colleague and friend of this blog, announced this post on ArchivesLive, the Ning group created by the ASA seemingly to replace the listserv. Pat Jackson, ASA President, has already responded with an update:
The ASA National Office has not lost the Aus-Archivists list-serv. We have moved from an outsourced service provider to managing our new server at the National Office.</description>

      <title>Goodbye, Aus-Archivists: Listservs and the Commitment to Digital Preservation</title>
      <link>https://matienzo.org/2010/goodbye-aus-archivists-listservs-and-the-commitment-to-digital-preservation/</link>

      <guid>https://matienzo.org/2010/goodbye-aus-archivists-listservs-and-the-commitment-to-digital-preservation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Aus-Archivists might not be gone for good, as ASA intends to share the entire run of postings on its website. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://matienzo.org/2010/aus-archivists-listserv-update/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for details.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my relative &lt;a href=&#34;https://matienzo.org/2010/giving-up-on-a-and-a/&#34;&gt;distaste for the A&amp;amp;A list&lt;/a&gt;, I have previously found it useful and &lt;a href=&#34;https://matienzo.org/2007/saa-listserv/&#34;&gt;argued for its retention&lt;/a&gt; when it was threatened in 2007. I still agree with most of what I wrote 3.5 years ago, although I might have toned things down in retrospect. In an effort to find other e-mail discussion lists on archives that engaged my interest, I joined &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mailman.srv.ualberta.ca/mailman/listinfo/arcan-l&#34;&gt;Arcan-L&lt;/a&gt; (the Canadian archivists&#39; listserv) and Aus-Archivists (the Australian archivists&#39; listserv, maintained by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.archivists.org.au/&#34;&gt;Australian Society of Archivists&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, Aus-Archivists had been idle since around the end of October. I noticed &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ausarchivists/status/29524056111&#34;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; from the Australian Society of Archivists only in passing at the beginning of November:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASA Office would just like everyone to know that our List Serv is still currently unavailable, we apologize for any inconvenience...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t hear anything else between then and earlier today. I should note that I&#39;m not a member of ASA, and so I can&#39;t speak to any communication they had with their membership. However, today a message was sent out by Pat Jackson, the ASA President, to all Aus-Archivists subscribers, announcing that the listserv was lost entirely. </description>

      <description>I&#39;d been long interested in starting to develop code using some sort of MapReduce implementation for distributed computing. I have never been able to get my head around Hadoop, so I gave up with that pretty quickly. I recently discovered Disco, a MapReduce framework with an Erlang-based core. Disco also allows you to to write your worker code in Python, which was a huge plus to me.
After stumbling through the tutorial, I took the word count demo and put together some basic code using pymarc that gathered tag count statistics for a bunch of MARC files.</description>

      <title>The Future of ArchivesBlogs</title>

      <description>Every project has it&#39;s day. I&#39;ve administered ArchivesBlogs for four years now. Originally, I created it to fill a void when blogging was new to the archival profession, and archivists were having to make the case for dedicating staff time to shepherding early social media projects. Four years later, things are much different; I&#39;m less interested in Web 2.0 (professionally speaking), more archivists are blogging, and more repositories are maintaining their own blogs.</description>

      <description>I am certainly not the first person to chime in on this topic, and I certainly hope not to be the last. Inspired by two fantastic posts by Ben Bromley and Maureen Callahan, I have chosen to discuss the reasons why I have given up on the Archives and Archivists List. Unlike Ben and Maureen, who discuss why they choose not to post to the list, I&#39;m also including reasons why I choose not to read or subscribe to the list anymore.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been meaning to blog about this for a while. DLIST, the Digital Library of Information Science and Technology, maintained by the University of Arizona School of Information Resources and Library Science, has been down for at least three months. Any URL formerly part of DLIST gets automatically redirected to an announcement page that reads as follows:

      <description>I recently returned from a trip to Asheville, North Carolina for this year&#39;s Code4lib conference. Despite the unavoidable hiccups that some attendees experienced as they tried to head home from the conference, I believe that this year&#39;s conference was the most successful one that I happened to attend. If I&#39;m right, I think this year had a record number of attendees, a record number of new attendees, and much tighter organization to make the new folks feel welcome.</description>

The first milestone of the Open Government Directive was met on January 22 with the release of new datasets on Data.gov. Each major government agency has uploaded at least three datasets in this initial action. The National Archives released the 2007‚Äî2009 Code of Federal Regulations and two datasets from its Archival Research Catalog.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s fitting that this the hundredth (gosh, only the hundredth?) post, because I have rather important news. First, my fellow developers/producers/UX designers at The New York Public Library and I have been dealing with every minute detail on the upcoming, Drupal-based replacement to the NYPL website. You can see a live preview at http://new.nypl.org/. I can proudly say that this project has helped both me personally and NYPL overall play nice in the open source world - we&#39;ve been actively contributing code, reporting bugs, and sending patches to the Drupal project.</description>

      <description>Clifford Lynch, Executive Director of the Coalition for Networked Information, has responded to the leaked SirsiDynix report that spreads horrific untruths about open source. Marshall Breeding posted Lynch&#39;s response on GuidePosts. In particular, Lynch notes the following:
I don&#39;t think that I ever wrote those words down in an article; I suppose I may have said something to that effect in an interview or q&amp;amp;a in some conference program like ALA Top Tech, though perhaps no quite as strongly as it&#39;s expressed here.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Twitter, I discovered that Wikileaks has posted a report written by SirsiDynix Vice President for Innovation StephenAbram which spreads a fantastic amount of fear, uncertainty and doubt about both open source software in general and, more specifically, the suitability of open source integrated library systems. As the summary provided by Wikileaks states,
This document was released only to a select number of existing customers of the company SirsiDynix, a proprietary library automation software vendor.</description>

      <description>Via Twitter, I heard about the Biodiversity Heritage Library&#39;s relatively new OpenURL Resolver, announced in their blog about a month ago. More specifically, I head about Matt Yoder&#39;s new Ruby library, rubyBHL, which exploits the BHL OpenURL Resolver to provide metadata about items in their holdings and does some additional screenscraping to return things like links to the OCRed version of the text.
In typical fashion, I&#39;ve ported Matt&#39;s library to Python, and have released my code.</description>

      <description>What exactly is archival access, and how does archival description make it possible? I feel like that in some form or another I&#39;ve been struggling with this question throughout my career. Recently, this blog post from The Top Shelf, the blog of the University of Texas at San Antonio Archives and Special Collections Department, came across my radar, wherein they write (emphasis in original):
UTSA Archives and Special Collections is among the growing number of archives to create an online presence for every one of its collections.</description>

More interestingly, she notes, is that the Times was given access and accordingly republished challenges from BPL patrons and other community members. Quite astutely, Jessamyn recognizes that
the patrons&#39; addresses are removed but their names and City/State information are published.</description>

Much of these thoughts have been stirring in my head as a result of my class at Rare Book School.

My classmates and I have been under the esteemed tutelage of Daniel Pitti, who has served as the technical architect for both EAD and EAC. Interestingly, there&#39;s been a whole lot of talk about linking data, linked data, and Linked Data, date normalization, and print versus online presentation, among other things.</description>

My article, &#34;Using the OCLC WorldCat APIs,&#34; appears in the latest issue (June 2009) of Python Magazine. I&#39;d like to thank my editor, Brandon Craig Rhodes, for helping me along in the process, not the least of which includes catching bugs that I&#39;d overlooked. The article includes a brief history lesson about OCLC, WorldCat, and the WorldCat Affiliate APIs, a detailed introduction to worldcat, my Python module to interact with OCLC&#39;s APIs, and a brief introduction to SIMILE Exhibit, which helps generate the holdings mashup referenced earlier on my blog.</description>

Hey, do you use Drupal on a site with several thousand nodes? Do you also use the Apache Solr Integration module?

I&#39;ve been playing around with some of the cultural heritage APIs that are available, some of which I learned about while I was at Museums and the Web 2009. While I was away I released code for a Python module for interacting with the Brooklyn Museum Collections API. After chatting with Virginia Gow from DigitalNZ, I also got motivated to write a Python module to interact with the DigitalNZ API.</description>

      <description>&#34;Electronic records&#34; is a particularly awful phrase and does not even actually capture anything about the underlying records at all. As far as the term goes, it&#39;s not too far off from &#34;machine readable records.&#34; As a profession, can we start actually thinking critically about the underlying technical issues and push for using terms that more accurately describe what it is we&#39;re dealing with? I understand it&#39;s a convenient catch-all term, but there is a large range of issues that differ with the kinds of data and systems.</description>

      <description>When Mark asked me to write about our use of Drupal at the Dickinson College Archives and Special Collections, the first thing I thought about was when our Archives Reference Blog was initially launched in April 2007. I couldn&#39;t believe that it has been two years already. I am pleased to report that my colleagues at Dickinson and I are enormously happy with the results of those two years. I hope others may find this brief explanation of how and why we are using Drupal as a reference management tool to be helpful and instructive.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been fairly quiet lately as I&#39;ve been busy with this and that, but I thought I&#39;d let everyone know that I&#39;ve been beginning to put together a series of posts entitled &#34;Drupal for Archivists.&#34; Drupal, as you may or may not know, is a flexible and extensible open source content management system. There will be a general overview of some of the important concepts, but it&#39;ll focus less on the basics of getting people up and running ‚Äî there are plenty of resources out there, such as the wonderful tutorials and articles available from Lullabot.</description>

      <description>The always groundbreaking Brooklyn Museum has now released an API to allow the public to interact with their collections data. I can&#39;t even tell you how happy I am about this in terms of an open data perspective. Also, this is the direction that makes the whole &#34;detailed curation by passionate amateurs&#34; thing possible.
There are only three simple methods for accessing the data. Ideally, it would be nice to see them put their collections metadata up as linked data, but now I&#39;m daring to dream a little.</description>

      <description>The Society of American Archivists released the Thesaurus for Use in College and University Archives as an electronic publication this week. Specifically, it was issued as a series of PDF files. Is this data stored in some sort of structured format somewhere? If so, it&#39;s not available directly from the SAA site. There&#39;s no good reason why TUCUA shouldn&#39;t be converted to structured, linkable data, expressed using SKOS, the Simple Knowledge Organization System.</description>

In particular, I&#39;m really looking forward to the linked data preconference.

This is what the sample output looks using my FOAF data.</description>

      <description>ArchivesNext recently inquired about how archivists measure success of 2.0 initiatives. It&#39;s hard to determine some 2.0-ish initiatives will really impact statistics when you don&#39;t really define what the results you&#39;re trying to see. I&#39;d like to open the question further ‚Äî how do we begin developing metrics for things that sit on the cusp between forms of outreach? Furthermore, I&#39;m curious to see where this information is captured ‚Äî do archivists wait until the end to gather survey data, or if they working towards something like we at NYPL Labs are doing with Infomaki, our new usability tool developed by Michael Lascarides, our user analyst.</description>

So, it&#39;s time for another rant about my issues with EAD. This one is a pretty straightforward and short one, and comes down to the issue that I should essentially be able to mix and match metadata schemas. This is not a new idea, and I&#39;m tired of the archives community treating it like it is one. Application profiles, as they are called, allow us to define a structured way to combine elements from different schemas, prevent addition of new and arbitrary elements, and tighten existing standards for particular use cases.</description>

Given an OCLC record number and a ZIP code, it plots the locations of the nearest holdings of that item on a Google Map. Pulled off in Python (as all good mashups should be), along with SIMILE Exhibit, it uses the following modules:
 geopy simplejson web.py and, of course, worldcat.  If you want to try it out, head on over here.</description>

      <description>The moderated discussion hosted and sponsored by Nylink went pretty well. Also, I don&#39;t need the records to have fun with the data &#34;‚Äù I just need robust APIs. (In fact, as I said today, I&#39;d prefer not to have to deal with the MARC records directly.) Robust APIs would help making prototypes like this one I hacked together in a few hours into a real, usable service.</description>

As I wrote over on the NYPL Labs blog, we&#39;ve been up to our necks in Drupal at MPOW, and I&#39;ve found that one of the great advantages of using it is rapid prototyping without having to write a whole lot of code. Again, that&#39;s how I feel about Python, too, but you knew that already.</description>

      <description>A while back, I wrote a Bad MARC Rant, and I considered titling this a Bad Metadata Rant. However, as the kids say, I got mad beef with a little metadata standard called Encoded Archival Description. Accordingly, I figured I should begin a new series of posts discussing some of these issues that I have with something that is, for better or for worse, a technological fixture of our profession. This is in part prompted by thoughts that I&#39;ve had as a result of participating in EAD@10 and attending the Something New for Something Old conference sponsored by the PACSCL Consortial Survey Initiative.</description>

The other Labs denizens and I are going off the rails on a crazy train deeper down the rabbit hole of reimplementing the NYPL site in Drupal. As I pile my work on the fire, I&#39;ve found that building things in Drupal is easier than I&#39;d ever thought it to be. It&#39;s a scary thought, in part because I&#39;m no fan of PHP (the language of Drupal&#39;s codebase).</description>

      <description>There&#39;s been a whole lot of discussion in the archivoblogosphere about the perceived need for quasi-informal interest groups that are fundamentally driven by identity. While I agree with this in theory, I must register my opposition to having SAA promote, support, or provide any sort of infrastructure for such groups. Fundamentally, I am against this because I believe it poses a strong threat to the privacy of archivists.</description>

      <description>You&#39;d think there was some sort of tried and true script for Delicious users to repost bookmarks from their inboxes into their accounts, especially given that there are often shared accounts where multiple people will tag things as &#34;for:foo&#34; to have them show up on foo&#39;s Delicious account. Well, there wasn&#39;t, until now (at least as far as I could tell).
Enter deliciouscopy. It uses pydelicious, as well as the Universal Feed Parser and simplejson.</description>

It&#39;s available either via download from my site or via PyPI; please submit bug reports to the issue tracker as they arise.

The gist of the talk was that &lt;a href=&#34;http://gaming.ala.org/&#34;&gt;gaming in libraries&lt;/a&gt; means not just using established games to draw the public into the library, but also to begin implementing game mechanics into libraries that allow them to flourish as social spaces. In particular, these game mechanics include things like collecting, points, feedback, exchanges, and customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been ruminating on this for the last week or so in a couple different ways. First of all, I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how we could implement game mechanics within NYPL.&lt;/p&gt;

Let me know if you discover any peculiarities in the updated set up.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Getting up to speed is hard anywhere, and it&#39;s especially difficult in a large, complex institution like &lt;abbr title=&#34;The New York Public Library&#34;&gt;NYPL&lt;/abbr&gt;. Other than just understanding the projects that you&#39;re given, you also are thrown headfirst into making sense of the culture, the organization, and all the unspoken and occasionally unseen things that allow you to do your job. There&#39;s no clear place to start this, so a good portion of the time you have to keep on top of that while you start thrashing away at your work. The question remains, though, how do you organize this stuff? How do you enable sensemaking in yourself and your peers?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Goodbye, WordPress - I&#39;ve been drinking more of the KoolAid. I rebuilt my personal/professional site (not this blog) in Drupal. Migrating the content was pretty easy (about 15 static pages, no posts). The functionality is astounding - I only started working on redoing it yesterday and I&#39;ve already got a great infrastructure. Expect a detailed post before too long, or at least a link to a colophon on said site.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m packing up and heading out to SFO this evening for SAA2008. Right now I&#39;m frantically backing up my Zotero repository, making sure I have a bunch of sources to peruse on the plane as I hack away on my slides for EAD@10. You might be surprised that my idea of me jumping out of a cake in the shape of an &amp;lt;archdesc&amp;gt; tag wearing a bathing suit was not even considered, so it looks like I&#39;ll actually have to put some coherent thoughts together.</description>

      <title>Bad MARC Rant #1: Leader Positions 06 and 08</title>

      <description>I understand why the MARC leader position 08 is a good idea in theory. In fact, MARBI Proposal 97-07 suggests:
a change in definition to Leader/08 code &#34;a&#34; for clarification; making code &#34;t&#34; (Manuscript language materials) obsolete in Leader/06 and using code &#34;a&#34; instead; redefinitions of codes &#34;a&#34; and &#34;p&#34; in Leader/06; renaming the 008 for Books to &#34;Textual (Nonserial); and deleting field 006 for Mixed material.
 I can safely say that some pretty funky stuff gets cataloged with the leader position 08 set as &#34;</description>

      <description>I&#39;d like to humbly announce that I&#39;ve written a pre-pre-alpha Python module for working with the WorldCat Search API and the xID APIs. The code needs a fair amount of work, namely unit tests and documentation. I&#39;ve released the code under the GPL.
The module, called &#34;worldcat&#34;, is available from the Python Package Index. You can also checkout a copy of the code from my Subversion repository.</description>

      <description>OCLC&#39;s Lorcan Dempsey makes a great point as usual in his post &#34;Making tracks&#34;:
In recent presentations, I have been suggesting that libraries will need to adopt more archival skills as they manage digital collections and think about provenance, evidential integrity, and context, and that they will also need to adopt more museum perspectives as they think about how their digital collections work as educational resources, and consider exhibitions and interpretive environments.</description>

      <description>After a little over two years processing, referencing, and cataloging, and hacking at AIP, I&#39;m skipping up to the City That Never Sleeps to join Jay Datema, Josh Greenberg, and company in the NYPL Labs. I&#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t thrilled about this opportunity, and I&#39;m ready to see where my new job will take me. The next major hurdle will be finding a place to live, so if you&#39;re privy to anything in Brooklyn, please let me know.</description>

      <description>The ICA&#39;s Committee of Best Practices and Standards released the first edition of the International Standard for Describing Functions (ISDF). Like much of ICA&#39;s other work in descriptive standards for archives, ISDF is designed to be used in conjunction with established standards such as ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF), as well as standards in preparation such as ISIAH. ISDF will assist both archivists and users to understand the contextual aspects of the creation of records of corporate bodies.</description>

      <description>Amidst this week of notorious hoaxes, Google has launched Google Message Discovery as an enterprise-focused add on for its Google Apps platform. Google Message Discovery goes well beyond a simple and reliable e-mail backup system and provides three key features of interest to records managers:
 Content-addressable storage for electronic mail stored immediately upon sending or retrieval Creating explicit retention policies based upon time Compliance with relevant laws and best practices Straightforward discovery for any use, regardless if internal or concerning litigation  Google Message Discovery, as well as other related offerings such as e-mail security, clearly has its origins in Google&#39;s acquisition of Postini last year.</description>

      <description>Since I&#39;m often required to hit the ground running at $MPOW on projects, I was a little concerned when I roped myself into assisting our photo archives with a Flickr project. The first goal was to get a subset of the photos uploaded, and quickly. Googling and poking around the Cheeseshop led me to Beej&#39;s FlickrAPI for Python. Little did I know that it would be dead simple to get this project going.</description>

      <description>ArchivesNext recently discussed Library Journal&#39;s annual list of &#34;Movers and Shakers,&#34; pondering what a comparable list in the archival profession would look like. For those who don&#39;t know, the list recognizes &#34;library advocates, community builders, 2.0 gurus, innovators, marketers, mentors, and problem solvers transforming libraries.&#34; After some rumination, ArchivesNext is now calling for nominations to generate a similar list. Do your civic duty and nominate either a project, an individual, or even a situation worthy of this recognition!</description>

This time around, I felt like I got a whole lot more out of attending; I&#39;m not sure if this is due to the changing nature of my job, increased attention, or some other factor, like neckferrets and dongles.</description>

      <description>I just discovered DataPortability.org through Peter Van Garderen&#39;s blog post about it. I was entirely surprised that I&#39;d heard nary a peep about it. Some basic examination (running a WHOIS query on the domain) shows that it&#39;s still a fairly new project. I have to say, though, that I&#39;m entirely impressed. Those involved have given a whole lot of thought to how they&#39;re going to be doing things, as evidenced by those who have signed up to be involved and the DataPortability Charter.</description>

      <description>After more than a few late nights and long weekends, I&#39;m proud to announce that I&#39;ve completed my latest pet programming project. zgw.py is a lightweight Z39.50-Web gateway, written, naturally, in Python. None of this would be possible without the following Python modules: Aaron Lav&#39;s PyZ3950, the beast of burden; Ed Summers&#39; pymarc, the smooth-talking translator; and web.py, quite possibly the best and most straightforward Python web framework available. I initially undertook this project as an excuse to play with PyZ3950 and to teach myself the workings of web.</description>

      <description>Many of Web 2.0&#39;s detractors argue about it&#39;s real value, but given the wildfires in Southern California, I was happy to see it really put to good use. KPBS, a San Diego radio station, has been using Flickr and, even more shocking (at least for some), Twitter as ways to disseminate information and news quickly. The use of Twitter is particularly interesting as it can send out SMS messages. You might recall a few years ago when protesters in the Philippines used SMS to organize political rallies and warn of police retaliation.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve updated ArchivesBlogs to the latest version of WordPress, as well as the latest versions of the plugins that do the heavy lifting (FeedWordPress and Auto Delete Posts). In so doing, I found that the database structure of WordPress 2.3 is radically different, causing some of my elegant work to break (namely, the use of the Auto Delete Posts plugin, for which I wrote a patch). You may have seen duplicate posts, no new posts on specific feeds (language and blog type), and possibly other unpredicted outcomes.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s a bad pun, but what can you expect from someone who neglects his blogs as much as I do?
I&#39;ve been busy, somewhat, and one of my latest forays has been getting a grip on Python, an absolutely wonderful programming language. I actually enjoy writing code again, which is more than a bit scary. I was sick of the mangled scripts and workflows I came up with at MPOW to handle converting MARC data to HTML and other such nonsense.</description>

      <description>ArchivesNext recently discussed the possibility of having some &#34;Archives 2.0&#34;-themed events this summer, and I think it&#39;s a great idea. Now, we may not be able to throw something together in time for SAA, but it seems like the idea of at least meeting up informally is percolating. There&#39;s a wealth of opportunities available for archives and archivists to improve access to their holdings through social software and the like. My vision, as I said in a comment on the post, would be to end up with an unconference along the lines of a Library Camp (or more generally, a BarCamp), maybe with lightning talks if enough of us have something to show off or talk about.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m a bit surprised that this hasn&#39;t come across anyone&#39;s radar, because it seems awfully damn significant to me. According to this post on the A&amp;amp;A listserv by Michael Ravnitzky, the National Archives and Records Administration released an exhaustive database of box holdings of all the Federal Records Centers. He doesn&#39;t really say how he obtained this database, but my guess is he just asked based upon his background and interest in public access to government information - I&#39;ve come across his name on material relating to FOIA before.</description>

      <description>I won&#39;t bother waiting to be tagged to do this, because all the cool kids already are. I read too many blogs already, so here we go.
 Mary Eats is, as one would easily assume, a blog about food. Mary started the blog while she and her husband were living in Korea, and thus there&#39;s an overwhelming emphasis on Korean food and restaurants. She moved to Seattle relatively recently and began culinary school, too.</description>

      <title>Two Work-Safe Tidbits about Archives and Erotica</title>

      <description>First, via my associates at booktruck.org, I came across a review of the comic book Demonslayer v. 2.2, by a certain Marat Mychaels, et al. at Comics Should Be Good. While the fact that the reviewers pan the comic book seems only marginally of interest to those of us wading in archivy, I should draw your attention to a specific part of this issue. Apparently one of the characters goes to visit the Director of Archives at the New York Museum of Natural History, who has chosen to decorate his office in the style of some seemingly life-sized works by (fellow Peruvian) Boris Vallejo.</description>

      <description>I finally noticed that FeedWordPress, the plugin I use to maintain ArchivesBlogs, has been updated within the last month to work with WordPress 2.1 and higher. I hope to get this working pretty soon, but I apologize in advance if it ends up going down for a few days.</description>

      <title>Throwing Out the Baby, the Bathwater, and the Bathtub: The Sad State of the Archives and Archivists Listserv</title>

      <description>Today, Nancy Beaumont, Executive Director of the Society of American Archivists, made an announcement on the Archives &amp;amp; Archivists listserv that SAA would no longer retain the first thirteen years of posts from the listserv. During this time the listserv was hosted by Miami University of Ohio, and last September, the list was moved to an SAA server. This stems from a decision made by SAA Council that they not retain the archives for three reasons: 1) an appraisal decision informed by the SAA&#39;s archives at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, 2) a consideration of administrative issues, and 3) a consideration of cost.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m really behind on posting, and I apologize. There are a few action items that I should mention before I clear my brain to allow me to start posting things with actual content.
 ArchivesBlogs moved, but mail to archivesblogs.com was not working for a while. A few people mentioned this to me, but I didn&#39;t get this resolved until just last week. After who knows how many attempts trying to get something posted on Boing Boing, I finally made it when I had more information about the hottest chili peppers in the world.</description>

      <description>I know, I know - you&#39;re probably thinking &#34;foams are so over,&#34; regardless which side of the molecular gastronomy fence you sit on. If you&#39;re a fan of the strange powders and physical state changes of food, you might be saying &#34;C&#39;mon, everybody knows that espuma is the new foam!&#34; Yeah, right - and aire is the new espuma. They&#39;re all pretty much the same thing, and you&#39;ve got to be bullshitting yourself if you think that Adri√† and his ilk don&#39;t know this already.</description>

      <description>I left work early yesterday for a doctor&#39;s appointment, which left little time for lunch. On the way there, I snacked on some almonds and raisins to tide me over. By the time I finally got done with the tests and consultation my stomach was making unholy groans that sounded like ghosts were plaguing my GI tract. Since there were a few things I wanted to pick up anyhow, I headed to Whole Foods and stopped by the deli first to get a sandwich.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the wonderful people at ibiblio, ArchivesBlogs will be changing hosts! If you&#39;re not familiar with ibiblio, it&#39;s one of the largest and oldest public digital library collections on the Internet. In addition to the upcoming hosting of ArchivesBlogs, ibiblio also hosts librarian.net and Library Web. Pardon any interruptions in access given the impending move; everything should be settled within a few days.
Also, a few changes I&#39;ve made to the backend should fix most of the continuing issues with certain feeds not aggregating.</description>

      <description>After many late nights toiling away, I&#39;m done with the latest version of ArchivesBlogs. I&#39;ve changed things quite a bit - most notably, I&#39;ve switched platforms from Plagger to Wordpress using the FeedWordpress plugin to do the heavy lifting of syndication. I&#39;ve decided to do away with the old OPML structure as well since the taxonomy wasn&#39;t as refined as I would have liked. Instead, FeedWordpress can categorize posts as they come in, which has allowed me to create a brand new taxonomy for ArchivesBlogs based on language.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about the biblioblogosphere&#39;s reaction to Casey Bisson&#39;s decision to use the $50,000 he was awarded by the Mellon Foundation for his work on WPopac to purchase LC bibliographic data and open it up to anyone who wanted to take a crack at it. Yes, this is a &#34;Good Thing,&#34; and valuable to the library community as a whole, but I feel like there are some things we&#39;re overlooking.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve written here, but other responsibilities at both at home and work have kept me busy. To get back into the swing of writing regularly, I thought I&#39;d take a look at one of the biggest hot-button topics in archives this year: the development and release of open source archival management systems. Between this year&#39;s and last year&#39;s SAA conferences, there were three sessions that, at least in part, dealt with the development of open source software for archives.</description>

      <description>The mid-Atlantic archivists are in a brief recess between now and the final session of the day, and it&#39;s been thoroughly interesting to say the least. I missed the caucus meetings this morning, unfortunately, but the plenary session was well worth it because it&#39;s got the gears turning about archival access systems even though it wasn&#39;t directly about them.
Paul Israel of the Edison Papers Project spoke at length about Edison&#39;s legacy and collaboration with others.</description>

I just got back from visiting the Morris Museum with a few folks, and now I&#39;m enjoying the (expensive) wireless connection here. This time around I don&#39;t know so many folks here, so shoot me an e-mail or comment if you&#39;re in attendance. Expect a more detailed post soon; I&#39;m exhausted from being up early to catch Amtrak!</description>

      <description>I know this post is well overdue, but the last few weeks have kept me extremely busy. Library Camp East was amazing; fun, thought-provoking, and inspiring. John Blyberg and Alan Kirk Gray (as well as the rest of the Darien Library Staff) did a heck of a job preparing for all of us descending into the auditorium. They even gave me a cool mug that my co-workers envy. I also finally got to meet Dan Chudnov and Casey Bisson, whose blogs I&#39;ve followed for a while now.</description>

      <description>After doing some frantic hacking this week I&#39;m happy to announce that I&#39;ve unveiled the second major revision to ArchivesBlogs. Other than a change in color, I have added the subscription list in the sidebar using a slightly modified version of Dan McTough&#39;s Optimal browser for OPML.The OPML file it renders is also the subscription list used by Plagger. Anyhow, let me know what you think. I&#39;m sure there are some kinks that need to be ironed out.</description>

Other things (even reading) have kept me busy, though, hence the unintentional neglect. I&#39;ve had plenty of time to reflect upon it at this point, so I might as well respond to some of his points.

      <description>During the Description Section meeting at this year&#39;s SAA conference, I made an informal proposal for a session concerning the changing nature of OPACs, changes in the library cataloging world, and the impact of those on descriptive practice in archives and manuscript repositories. I&#39;d like to invite any of you, if you&#39;re interested, to let me know if you&#39;d be interested in assisting me with putting together a proposal on this topic.</description>

      <description>After two weeks of use, Plagger has proven itself to be pretty resilient. I&#39;ve been asking myself how I can make ArchivesBlogs even better, and I&#39;ve finally got a few ideas.
 A site redesign. I&#39;d like different colors. Categorizing the feeds, e.g. separating blogs by individuals from repository blogs. This will probably end up with me creating a couple of Plagger configurations and dumping them into different subdirectories on ArchivesBlogs.</description>

      <description>ArchivesBlogs has been going strong for over a week now. If you use Blogspot and had a blog previously syndicated by ArchivesBlogs, your content may be temporarily unsyndicated. The specific problem is HTTP 502 error, which seems to indicate a problem with a proxy server at Blogspot. In any rate, they should return soon enough -- it would be nice to have the 9 blogs back!</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve upgraded Plagger (the software behind ArchivesBlogs) to the latest version and it&#39;s allowed me to add service links to del.icio.us, unalog, digg, Reddit, and Technorati. I suppose I could add more (ma.gnolia, Furl, etc.), but I&#39;ll hold off doing that for the sake of cluttering the interface for the time being. If you have any service links you&#39;d like to see, let me know and I might be able to hack something together.</description>

      <description>Since my last post about syndicating blogs about archives, I&#39;ve played around with the idea and different software packages to do it, including Planet and Plagger. I&#39;m happy to announce that after a few days work I was able to put something together.
ArchivesBlogs is an aggregator for blogs about archives. It runs Plagger and updates hourly, outputting HTML, RSS, Atom, OPML (for import into other aggregator), and a FOAFroll. The site design is simple, but i&#39;m happy with it.</description>

 Geof Huth took notes on the SAA Awards Ceremony, Christie Peterson pitted Archon against Archivist&#39;s Toolkit, Jessamyn West blogged about her session on blogs, Peter Van Garderen discusses his experience at the conference including his session on archives and Web 2.</description>

      <description>The Archival Solidarity Session was really great and generated a lot of dialog. It was originally organized by Nancy Marrelli of Concordia University (Montr√©al), but she couldn&#39;t make it on account of a family emergency. Trudy Huskamp Peterson led the discussion in her place and did a wonderful job. Essentially, Archival Solidarity is a project involving the ICA&#39;s Section of Professional Associations that concerns &#34;international archival development&#34; through bilateral projects. There are several major issues at play.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m at the Hilton Washington, the site of the SAA conference. I&#39;ve registered and picked up my free totebag. I, and others, have bemoaned the lack of connectivity in the conference area. Wireless is only available in the lobby, so it seems, and it&#39;s rather pricy ($5.95 for 4 hours or $9.95 for 24 hours). I know archivists are often thought of as being technologically behind (whether we are is a Pandora&#39;s box that I won&#39;t open in this post), but I feel that some sort of net access is necessary at every conference.</description>

This will be my first release in a while (other than the collab CD with myself, Cotton Museum, and Actual Birds on Casanova Temptations).</description>

I&#39;d like to say that it went off without a hitch, but it didn&#39;t. It did, however, go mostly well, and I realized that my problem was that I continued to use applications while Adept installed the new packages. I couldn&#39;t install all the packages, and I ended up with a minorly disfunctional kernel that wouldn&#39;t allow ndiswrapper to load properly, preventing me from using my internal wireless card.</description>

      <description>The technical services world has been in an uproar lately, between LC&#39;s decision to stop creating series authority records (particularly since they didn&#39;t consult PCC members beforehand) and the fallout after Calhoun report. We might as well have another drink, because as librarian.net reports (along with several others), OCLC and RLG are about to merge. It&#39;s mindblowing to think that RLG employees did not find out any sooner than the rest of us, and that either organization has yet to consult its members.</description>

      <description>Nearly a year ago I switched from Wordpress to Drupal. I chose to switch back, partially because it was capable of doing way more than I needed it to! I thought I didn&#39;t want to be limited by blog software, but apparently that&#39;s not a terribly huge concern anymore. The old site had frightfully little content (three posts in Dalliance, a few personal posts, and links to papers). I&#39;m redoing my non-blog site with PURLs since I don&#39;t have access to an e-prints server to which I can upload my varied previous academic work.</description>

      <description>A little over a month ago, Nick Gerakines posted a Perl script to be called from a Procmail configuration file. It seemed to work pretty well, but the anal-retentive cataloger/standards geek in me decided to pass the results through a feed validator. It failed in a few key areas: missing version attribute in the rss tag, improper guid and link tags, and a pubDate with a non-RFC822 date. These all seemed pretty easy to fix, so I went ahead and made some changes.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve finally gotten around to doing some serious work on the site. I&#39;ve completed the first post for my defunct blog, and it&#39;s about one of my favorite songwriters ever, Dr. Franklin Bruno. I&#39;ve also figured out some of the odd intricacies of Drupal and am finally getting this site to have a look and feel of which I can be proud.
I&#39;ve settled in nicely to Washington, DC, and I&#39;m living in a decent area of town within a reasonable interest of a decent watering hole, groceries, and the Metro.</description>
