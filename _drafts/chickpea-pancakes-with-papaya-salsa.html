<p>I know it's been a heck of a long time since I've posted anything. I could give excuses, but there'd be no point in that. Getting back to the task at hand, let's get to the recipe! The main part of the dish, the chickpea pancakes, were a staple during my vegan days. The papaya salsa is another favorite of mine, and I've made countless variations on it through the years.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 c. chickpea flour (last time I used a chickpea/fava blende)</li>
<li>1 1/2 c. warm water</li>
<li>1 tsp. cumin</li>
<li>1 tsp. coriander</li>
<li>1/2 tbsp. oregano</li>
<li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
<li>1 tbsp. ginger, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 medium or 1/2 large papaya, chopped</li>
<li>1/2</li>
</ul>
