The Serving Library (w Angie Kiefer and Stuart ?)
Storing/structuring information as practice. Not a typical library. Publishing "bulletins" (texts focused on contemporary art, design, media) through website. Texts are published as "bound works" in PDF form; adds objecthood. PDFs have embedded time stamps. Printed works based on these PDFs. 

* Ben Vershbow

"Raising the baseline of access" through APIs

* Ariane Roth and Roland Fr√ºh (Sitterwerk)

Based in St. Gallen, Sittertal. Famous for having oldest library in Switzerland. "Material archive" forms basis of collections among others. Other museum/object collections as well. Also near foundry for art, fabrication, photo lab, etc. Kunstbibliothek, Materialarchiv. Founded by Daniel Rohner (architect); "followed art scene by buying books." Ended up at Sitterwerk/Art Foundry by coincidence. RFID tags introduced on Rohner's passing.

* Anthon Anstrom and Lukas Zimmer

Werkbank addresses the dislike of lists. External objects could also not be recorded. Is there way to have work developed in the library flow back to it?

desk tracks position with 12 RFID antennae; camera on photo stand with image recognition software

Anstrom/Zimmer's MAPS application - http://perspectives.io/ - to map objects into a service

Gradient tagging: intended to represent relationships between objects
