<p>Hey, do you use <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> on a site with several thousand nodes? Do you also use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/apachesolr">Apache Solr Integration module</a>? If you're like me, you've probably needed to reindex your site but couldn't be bothered to wait for those pesky cron runs to finish â€” in fact, that's what led me to file a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/456420">feature request</a> on the module to begin with.</p>
<p>Well, fret no more, because thanks to me and Greg Kallenberg, my illustrious fellow Applications Developer at <a href="http://labs.nypl.org/">NYPL DGTL</a>, you can finally use Drupal's Batch API to reindex your site. The module is available as an <a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/apachesolr_batch_reindex-6.x-1.1.tar_.gz">attachment</a> from that <a href="http://drupal.org/node/456420#comment-1587246">same issue node</a> on drupal.org.  Nota bene: this is a really rough module, with code swiped pretty shamelessly from the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/180528">Example Use of the Batch API</a> page on drupal.org. It works, though, and it works well enough as we tear stuff down and build it back up over and over again.</p>
