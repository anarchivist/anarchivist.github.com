<p>Earlier today I'd posted about the <a href="/2010/aus-archivists-listserv/">Australian Society of Archivists' announcement</a> about the Aus-Archivists listserv being "lost." <a href="http://discontents.com.au/">Tim Sherratt</a>, an Australian colleague and friend of this blog, <a href="http://archiveslive.ning.com/forum/topics/the-archives-of-the-archives">announced this post</a> on ArchivesLive, the Ning group created by the ASA seemingly to replace the listserv. Pat Jackson, ASA President, has already responded with an update:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ASA National Office has not lost the Aus-Archivists list-serv. We  have moved from an outsourced service provider to managing our new  server at the National Office. The Aus-Archivists list-serv was a bit  too ancient for our spanking new server to manage.</p>
<p>In terms of the posterity of the contents of the list-serv, the  wonderful discussions and debate it fostered and engendered, they are  not lost. It is our intention to post them to the ASA website where they  can be perused. Further to that, it is my understanding that the  Aus-Archivists list-serv is also deemed to be permanent under the ASA  retention schedule. The ASA will be investigating other methods of  storing the list-serv for permanent retention.</p>
<p>I can not give you a date or a time line for the Aus-Archivists  list-serv to be put up on the website. This is one of many tasks that  the National Office is currently undertaking. Please bear in mind that  the National Office is probably smaller than most small archives and  they have to service a wide and dispersed membership base. And today  they were overwhelmed by the positive feedback of many of our members.</p></blockquote>
<p>I thank Pat for being willing to clarify the situation of Aus-Archivists, and I'm relieved to hear that ASA intends to provide the run of the list on its website and that it considers the list to be records suitable for permanent retention. I do understand that resources are limited, and I would love to see ASA or Aus-Archivist's constituencies try to help ASA with this process if it's possible or preferable.</p>
