I'm at [IndieWebCamp NYC](https://indiewebcamp.com/2016/NYC) and I just added
some [microformats](http://microformats.org/) data to my site. Hurrah!

**Edit**: And I've successfully sent a [Webmention](http://indiewebcamp.com/Webmention)
by hand from the command line. Time to add that to the Jekyll build process...
