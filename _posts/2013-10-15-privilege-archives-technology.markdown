Like others, I found the [presidential address of Jackie Dooley](http://www2.archivists.org/history/leaders/jackie-m-dooley/2013-saa-presidential-address-by-jackie-dooley) last August's Society of American Archivists annual meeting to be problematic. At the time, I had little more to add than what was articulated by others, such as Sam Winn's post on [professional privilege](http://archivasaurus.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/professional-privilege-a-response-to-the-2013-saa-presidential-address/). As the dust settles, though I've gotten a lot more clarity.

The Society of American Archivists is not really an easy place to examine our privilege or our struggle. There are many ways in which we desperately need to examine privilege within the context of our profession as well as the overall organization, but for now, I'm going to limit this post to addressing an issue that has been racing through my head since the SAA annual meeting, which concern privilege and the intersection of archives and technology, the area in which I work. 

I am nothing if not enthusiastic about open culture and open source software and their transformative potential. I release my own work (meaning software, presentations, writing, etc.) under an open source or Creative Commons license whenever possible, and I've spend the better part of the last three and a half years working on technology projects within archives that have developed open source software ([ArchivesSpace](http://archivesspace.org/) and the [AIMS](http://www.digitalcurationservices.org/aims) project, which developed the requirements for and prototype of [Hypatia](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/HYPAT/Home)). Yet I'm troubled when I am put in the position of having to encourage colleagues to participate in open source, knowing that only [1.5% of open source community members are women](http://flosspols.org/deliverables/D16HTML/FLOSSPOLS-D16-Gender_Integrated_Report_of_Findings.htm), that [incidents of sexism](http://geekfeminism.org/2009/08/19/why-we-document/) (trigger warnings on links from that post) are so rampant that they merit being documented, and that women and people of color in <s>my</s> **our** profession can't speak out for fear of having charges of [snark](http://gavialib.com/2013/09/silencing-librarianship-and-gender-on-snark-and-tone-arguments/) or [airing dirty laundry](http://gavialib.com/2013/10/silencing-librarianship-and-gender-dirty-laundry-and-its-airing/) leveled against them. I also have my concerns that "digital archives" (whatever that may be) is becoming one of the least diverse and welcoming areas of our profession, despite there being a history of amazing women working in this field like Margaret Hedstrom and Nancy McGovern.

There are a few things that I want to do to start to fix this, to make this space of the profession to be more safe, welcoming, and supportive:

**Restructuring the dynamic of continuing archival education and mentorship.** I am not convinced that continuing archival education is really all that helpful beyond getting either a big picture view or focusing minutely on using specific tools. In many cases we presume that the level of expertise of the instructor far exceeds that of the student. Despite being a so-called "expert" in born digital records and software development for this profession, I disclaim this expertise by realizing that the process of learning for this stuff has to be continuous, and is largely driven by focusing on either relevance to a task at hand or personal curiosity. Satisfying the latter is usually only possible if you have some degree of privilege. What I'd like to see is a different type of educational dynamic where people with different backgrounds and strengths, types professional experience, and issues to solve come together with some regularity - to share skills, to look to each other for counsel, and to break bread together as equals as we progress forward on common goals. I think this absolutely has to happen at a smaller level than an organization like SAA, and perhaps locally is the best option.

**Developing explicitly safe spaces for professional interaction.** I've seen many definitions for safe space, but that developed by [Advocates for Youth](http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=607&Itemid=177) is by far one of the clearest:

> a place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person's self-respect and dignity and strongly encourage everyone to respect others

Despite my concerns about SAA's efficacy for some of these issues, an actionable effort for SAA would be to develop a [code of conduct for its events](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Event_Guidelines). I am happy to say that [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org) adopted a [code of conduct](https://github.com/code4lib/antiharassment-policy/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) over the last year, as did the [Digital Library Federation](http://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/). Stanford University Libraries also have [strongly encouraged](http://library.stanford.edu/news/2013/07/sul-supports-conference-anti-harassment-policies) their employees to only attend conferences with anti-harassment policies.

I'm also hoping to try out this educational model I mentioned above within the New York area some time soon, and I'd like to get together with others interested in getting a better understanding of applied technology and how we collaborate that values everyone's expertise equally. In the short term, I've also decided to organize a [Computer Anonymous](http://computeranonymous.org/) group in New York with Alex Duryee. Computer Anonymous (which doesn't have anything to do with Anonymous) describes itself as the following:

> This might be the group for you if you want to meet socially conscious nerds to talk about interesting things. This is not an entrepreneurial meetup, nor is it networking: It is a support group, a place to meet good people and talk about good and bad things. ... [T]he primary goal is to create a social group for people in and around tech, from all backgrounds, where they feel comfortable and welcome.
