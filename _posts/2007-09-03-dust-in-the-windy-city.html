<p>SAA2007 came and went. Everyone knows that I'm no good at liveblogging or semi-liveblogging, so don't expect an exhaustive report - potentially better sources include <a href="http://archivesnext.com/">ArchivesNext</a> and <a href="http://spellboundblog.com/">Spellbound Blog</a>. Here are my personal highlights, which is just about the best that this here boy archivist can pull off.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pre-conference SAA Research Forum. While I only got to see the second half of the day, this is where the meat was according to those who were there for the whole thing.</li>
<li>The Description Section steering committee meeting. This was probably the most instructive for me as I'm the incoming chair.</li>
<li>Hacking away on my remarks most of the week and successfully pulling off <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/saa2007/index.php/Session:_Rethinking_Access_and_Descriptive_Practice_%28Session_503%29">our session</a>. Jennifer Schaffner from OCLC/RLG Programs substituted for Merrilee Proffitt and did a swell job. She's a great person to discuss all these crazy ideas with for two reasons - she's established in the profession and new to OCLC! I eagerly await her posts at <a href="http://hangingtogether.org/">hangingtogether.org</a>. One of these days soon I'll put up my slides and notes, and some of my remarks I owe to the brainwork of <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/">dchud</a> (naturally, I give him credit).</li>
<li>The informal Web 2.0 meeting. I got to meet some of the many <a href="http://archivesblogs.com/">ArchivesBloggers</a> and a whole bunch of other new folks. We had some great discussions, too, and are starting a plan of attack.</li>
<li>Meeting tons of archivists from all over the place. Other than the ones I knew already, the most fun was had with the North Carolinans and West Coasters.</li>
<li>The food. Oh, God, the food. Armenian at Sayat Nova, which is just downstairs from the Second Story Bar, the diviest gay bar I'd been to in forever. Chicago-style pizza at Giordano's and Pizzeria Due. Organic Mexican at Wholly Frijoles in the burbs with former Ann Arbor housemates. The unagi bento box I quickly scarfed down before our session. Osso buco over risotto at Volare. Everything else I can't remember.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I had a great time, and somehow emerged alive out of a stressful week. Thanks to everyone who told me how much the appreciate ArchivesBlogs and thanks to those who appreciate my chaotic ramblings. See you in San Francisco!</p>
