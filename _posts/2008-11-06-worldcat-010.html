<p>In preparation for the upcoming <a href="http://worldcat.org/devnet/wiki/2008NYCHackathon">WorldCat Hackathon</a> starting this Friday, I've made a few changes to <a href="http://matienzo.org/project/worldcat">worldcat</a>, my Python module for interacting with OCLC's APIs. Most notably, I've added iterators for SRU and OpenSearch requests, which (like the rest of the module) painfully need documentation. It's available either via download from my site or <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/worldcat/">via PyPI</a>; please submit bug reports to the <a href="http://matienzo.org/project/issues/worldcat">issue tracker</a> as they arise.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've bumped up the version number another micro number to 0.1.1 as I've just added the improvements <a href="http://worldcat.org/devnet/blog/2008/11/lccn_support_and_other_improve.html">mentioned by Xiaoming Liu on the WorldCat DevNet Blog</a> (LCCN query support, support for tab-delimited and CSV responses for xISSNRequests, and support for PHP object responses for all xIDRequests).</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks to Thomas Dukleth, I was told that code for the Hackathon was to be licensed under the BSD License. Accordingly, I've now dual licensed the module under both GPL and BSD.</p>
