<p><strong>UPDATE: The text of my remarks can be now found online at <a href="http://matienzo.org/2011/wikileaks-panel/">http://matienzo.org/presentations/2011/wikileaks-panel/</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I am honored to be one of the speakers at "<a href="http://www.nycarchivists.org/?p=672">WikiLeaks &amp; the Archives &amp; Records Profession</a>," a panel discussion organized by the <a href="http://www.nycarchivists.org/">Archivists Roundtable of Metropolitan New York</a> and the <a href="http://www.armanyc.org/">Metropolitan New York City Chapter of ARMA International</a>. The panel will be on <strong>January 25, 2011</strong> at the Center for Jewish History. From the announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do WikiLeaks and its complex, attendant issues shift our conceptualization of our roles as information professionals?  How might WikiLeaks change the public's views on usage of and access to archives and records?  To what extent is the most recent release of diplomatic cables a product of information mismanagement?</p>
<p>Addressing these and many more questions, our confirmed speakers include <strong><a href="http://trudypeterson.com/">Trudy Peterson</a></strong>, former Acting Archivist of the United States (1993-1995) and current representative for the Society of American Archivists on the Department of State's Historical Advisory Committee; <strong>Fred Pulzello</strong>, Solutions Architect in the Information Governance practice at MicroLink LLC; <strong>Jim Fortmuller</strong>, Manager of Systems Security at Kelley Drye &amp; Warren LLP in Washington, DC; <a href="http://matienzo.org/"><strong>Mark Matienzo</strong></a>, Digital Archivist in Manuscripts and Archives at Yale University Library; and <a href="http://www.brooklaw.edu/faculty/directory/facultymember/biography.aspx?id=derek.bambauer"><strong>Derek Bambauer</strong></a>, Associate Professor of Law at Brooklyn Law School.  The panel will be moderated by <a href="http://history.as.nyu.edu/object/peterwosh.html"><strong>Peter Wosh</strong></a>, Director of the Archives/Public History Program and Clinical Associate Professor of History at New York University.</p></blockquote>
