<p>It's been some time since I've had a substantive post, and I don't really intend to write one now. I figured I should mention, however, that I've been featured lately in print and in the blogosphere. Jessamyn West of <a href="http://librarian.net/">librarian.net</a> interviewed me for an article ("<a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6430408.html">Saving Digital History</a>") in <em>Library Journal netConnect</em>. In addition, I was tapped by the wonderful folks at <a href="http://booktruck.wordpress.com/">Booktruck</a> for the <a href="http://booktruck.wordpress.com/2007/04/27/ask-a-male-librarian-deux/">latest installment</a> in their "Ask a Male Librarian" series. I swear someday soon I'll write something much more interesting and less self-promotional.</p>
