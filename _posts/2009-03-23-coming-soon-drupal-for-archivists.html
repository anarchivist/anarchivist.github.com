<p>I've been fairly quiet lately as I've been busy with this and that, but I thought I'd let everyone know that I've been beginning to put together a series of posts entitled "Drupal for Archivists." <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, as you may or may not know, is a flexible and extensible open source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management system</a>. There will be a general overview of some of the important concepts, but it'll focus less on the basics of getting people up and running â€” there are plenty of resources out there, such as the wonderful <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/articles">tutorials and articles available from Lullabot</a>. Instead, I've drafted a handful of guest bloggers to discuss how and why they're using Drupal. Keep your eyes peeled!</p>
