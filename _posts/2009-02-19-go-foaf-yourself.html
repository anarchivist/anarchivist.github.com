<p>I'm really looking forward to next week's <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2009">code4lib conference</a> in Providence, despite my utter failure to complete or implement the project on which I am presenting. In particular, I'm really looking forward to the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/LinkedData">linked data preconference</a>. Like some of my other fellow attendees, I've hammered out a <abbr title="Friend of a Friend">FOAF</abbr> file for the preconference already so that <a href="http://inkdroid.org/">Ed Summers</a>' combo <a href="http://inkdroid.org/c4l2009/attendees">FOAF crawler and attendee info web app</a>.</p>

<p>This is what the sample output looks using my FOAF data. It's good to see we're well on our way to have an easily creatable sample type of RDF data for people to play with. At a bare minimum, you can create your FOAF data using <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic">FOAF-A-Matic</a> and then edit it to add the assertions you need to get it to play nice with Ed's application. See you in Providence, but go FOAF yourself first.</p>
