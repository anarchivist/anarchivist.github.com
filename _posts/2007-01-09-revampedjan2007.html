<p>After many late nights toiling away, I'm done with the latest version of <a href="http://archivesblogs.com/">ArchivesBlogs</a>. I've changed things quite a bit - most notably, I've switched platforms from <a href="http://plagger.org/">Plagger</a> to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> using the <a href="http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress/">FeedWordpress</a> plugin to do the heavy lifting of syndication. I've decided to do away with the old OPML structure as well since the taxonomy wasn't as refined as I would have liked. Instead, FeedWordpress can categorize posts as they come in, which has allowed me to create a brand new taxonomy for ArchivesBlogs based on language. Each language can also have its own feed now. The one thing missing that I'm really itching to put back in place are the social bookmarking links; none of the plugins I've come across so far seem to like my theme, so I may just end up writing my own plugin. Anyhow, please give me feedback - I'm itching to do more.</p>
