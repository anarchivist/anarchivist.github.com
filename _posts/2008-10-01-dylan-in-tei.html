<p>Via <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=659">Language Log</a>: The <a href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab</a> (ETCL) at the University of Victoria has, in an effort to draw more attention to <abbr title="Text Encoding Initiative">TEI</abbr>, chosen to prepare an <a href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/tei/Encoded_Dylan_Lyrics.xml">encoded version</a> of the lyrics to Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues" and overlaid the resulting XML over the song's video. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sHYDfITjHY">resulting video</a> is available, naturally, on YouTube.</p>
<p>{% include youtube.html id="4sHYDfITjHY" %}</p>
<p>ETCL's Ray Siemens <a href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/tei/?p=6">writes about the reasoning behind this</a> on the <a href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/tei">TEI Video Widgets blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the last gathering of the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium, in Maryland, a few of us were discussing the ways in which TEI has eluded some specific types of social-cultural representation that are especially current today . . . things like an avatar, or something that could manifest itself as a youtube posting. A quick search of youtube did reveal a significant and strong presence of sorts, but it was that of Tei the Korean pop singer (pronounced, we're told, "Ëœtay'); so, our quest began there, setting out modestly to create a video widget that would balance T-E-I and Tei in the youtube world.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, a high-quality MP4 video is available for download for those so inclined. This has just about made my week.</p>
