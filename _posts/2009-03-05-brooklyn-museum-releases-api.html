<p>The always groundbreaking <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/">Brooklyn Museum</a> has now <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/2009/03/04/brooklyn-museum-collection-api/">released an API</a> to allow the public to interact with their collections data. I can't even tell you how happy I am about this in terms of an open data perspective. Also, this is the direction that makes the whole "<a href="http://www.archivesnext.com/?p=228">detailed curation by passionate amateurs</a>" thing possible.</p>
<p>There are only <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/">three simple methods</a> for accessing the data. Ideally, it would be nice to see them put their collections metadata up as linked data, but now I'm daring to dream a little. Hey, wait a minute! I think that's the perfect way to start playing around with the API. Doing some digging through the documentation, I'm seeing that all the <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/docs/response/object">objects</a> and <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/docs/response/artist">creators</a> seem to have URIs. Take a crack at it - <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/register/">the registration form</a> is ready for you.</p>
