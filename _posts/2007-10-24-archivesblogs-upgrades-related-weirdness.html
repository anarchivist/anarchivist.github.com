<p>I've updated <a href="http://archivesblogs.com/">ArchivesBlogs</a> to the latest version of WordPress, as well as the latest versions of the plugins that do the heavy lifting (<a href="http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress/">FeedWordPress</a> and <a href="http://digitalwestex.org/2007/03/23/auto-delete-posts-for-wordpress/">Auto Delete Posts</a>). In so doing, I found that the database structure of WordPress 2.3 is radically different, causing some of my elegant work to break (namely, the use of the Auto Delete Posts plugin, for which I wrote a <a href="http://matienzo.org/CodeSnippets">patch</a>). You may have seen duplicate posts, no new posts on specific feeds (language and blog type), and possibly other unpredicted outcomes. Everything seems to be working properly now, so if you see anything strange or that doesn't work, let me know.</p>
