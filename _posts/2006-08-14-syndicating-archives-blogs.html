<p>I still haven't had enough time to process everything I took in or ideas I came up with as a result of the SAA conference. Many were more diligent than I and I'm sorry to say I didn't meet them, but some highlights follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geof Huth took notes on the <a href="http://anarchivist.blogspot.com/2006/08/600-700-saa-awards-ceremony.html">SAA Awards Ceremony,</a></li>
<li>Christie Peterson pitted <a href="http://www.foldering.com/?p=8">Archon against Archivist's Toolkit,</a></li>
<li>Jessamyn West blogged about her <a href="http://www.librarian.net/stax/1814/trackback/">session on blogs,</a></li>
<li>Peter Van Garderen discusses his <a href="http://archivemati.ca/2006/08/06/saa-2006-annual-conference">experience at the conference</a> including his session on archives and Web 2.0,</li>
<li>and Merrilee Proffitt from <acronym title="Research Libraries Group">RLG</acronym> mentioned the <a href="http://hangingtogether.org/?p=121">blog session and RLG Roundtable</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not even up to speed on the rest of the archival blogs out there. In a stroke of genius and madness I've got an idea that I may put into motion. I'm thinking about setting up an instance of <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet</a>, a Python-powered web-based news aggregator. It's pretty common in the <acronym title="Free/Libre/Open-Source Software">FLOSS</acronym> world, and has been picked up by the <a href="http://code4lib.org/">code4lib</a> folks; they're running theirs as <a href="http://planet.code4lib.org/">planet code4lib</a>. One of the reasons I think this is a good idea is that one doesn't need to use an aggregator (Bloglines, NetNewsWire, what have you) to get all of the content at once. This in turn eliminates a hurdle from those archivists that are not technically minded: they just need to be told to go to a single website to read everything.  What do you think? Would you be willing to take part?</p>
