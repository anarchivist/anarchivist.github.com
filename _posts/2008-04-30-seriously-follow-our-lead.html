<p>OCLC's Lorcan Dempsey makes a great point as usual in his post "<a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/001626.html">Making tracks</a>":</p>
<blockquote><p>In recent presentations, I have been suggesting that libraries will need to adopt more archival skills as they manage digital collections and think about provenance, evidential integrity, and context, and that they will also need to adopt more museum perspectives as they think about how their digital collections work as educational resources, and consider exhibitions and interpretive environments.</p></blockquote>
<p>I doubt that any archivist would disagree with this. Even better, I think this offers a great opportunity to reach out and have those in allied fields really understand how and why we've done things slightly different for so long. I'm glad to see that <a href="/2008/now-it-can-be-told">my new employer</a> has picked up on this holistic approach with platforms like the <a href="http://nypl.org/blog">NYPL Blogs</a>.</p>
