<p>I'm happy to pass on the news that my former employer, the <a href="http://www.aip.org/history/">Niels Bohr Library &amp; Archives</a> of the <a href="http://www.aip.org/">American Institute of Physics</a>, has received funding from the National <a href="http://www.archives.gov/nhprc/">Historical Publications and Records Commission</a> to digitize the entirety of the Samuel Goudsmit papers. From the announcement on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/College-Park-MD/Center-for-History-of-PhysicsNiels-Bohr-Library-Archives/9563338557?ref=nf#/pages/College-Park-MD/Center-for-History-of-PhysicsNiels-Bohr-Library-Archives/9563338557">Center for History of Physics/Niels Bohr Library &amp; Archives Facebook page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Goudsmit (1902â€”1978) was a Dutch-educated physicist who spent his career in the US and was involved at the cutting edge of physics for over 50 years. He was an important player in the development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s and 1930s; he then served as scientific head of the Alsos Mission during World War II, which assessed the progress of the German atomic bomb project. Goudsmit became a senior scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory and editor-in-chief of the American Physical Society. The papers consist of an estimated 66,000 documents, which include correspondence, research notebooks, lectures, reports, and captured German war documents; the collection is the most used in the library.  This is the first manuscript collection that we will digitize, and it will become one of the few complete history-of-physics collections online. We plan to make the collection freely available online by summer 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>AIP's finding aid to the Goudsmit papers is <a href="http://www.aip.org/history/ead/20000092_content.html">available online</a>. Congratulations to the staff of the NBLA!</p>
