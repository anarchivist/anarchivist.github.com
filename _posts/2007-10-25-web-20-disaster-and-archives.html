<p>Many of Web 2.0's detractors argue about it's real value, but given the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=san%20diego%20fires">wildfires in Southern California</a>, I was happy to see it really put to good use. <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/">KPBS</a>, a San Diego radio station, has been using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/sandiegofires/pool/map?mode=group">Flickr</a> and, even more shocking (at least for some), <a href="http://twitter.com/kpbsnews">Twitter</a> as ways to disseminate information and news quickly. The use of Twitter is particularly interesting as it can send out SMS messages. You might recall a few years ago when <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-06-30-politics-text-tool_x.htm?csp=34">protesters in the Philippines used SMS</a> to organize political rallies and warn of police retaliation. The California State Library Blog also has provided <a href="http://blog.library.ca.gov/archive/2007/10/24/California-State-Archivist-reports-on-status-of-archives_2C00_-museums-in-affected-fire-areas.aspx">information from the California State Archivist</a> about archives affected by the fires. In addition, information about disaster recovery for libraries and archives is available both on a regional level by the <a href="http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/sildrn/">San Diego/Imperial County Libraries Disaster Response Network</a>  and on the state level by the <a href="http://calpreservation.org/services/disaster_assist.html">California Preservation Program</a>. Please hold those affected by the fires in your thoughts, and if you can, contact SILDRN or the CPP to help.</p>
