<p><a href="http://www.cni.org/staff/clifford_index.html">Clifford Lynch</a>, Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.cni.org/">Coalition for Networked Information</a>, has responded to the <a href="/2009/leaked-sirsidynix-report">leaked SirsiDynix report</a> that spreads horrific untruths about open source. Marshall Breeding <a href="http://www.librarytechnology.org/blog.pl?ThreadID=134&amp;BlogID=1">posted Lynch's response on GuidePosts</a>. In particular, Lynch notes the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't think that I ever wrote those words down in an article; I suppose I may have said something to that effect in an interview or q&amp;a in some conference program like ALA Top Tech, though perhaps no quite as strongly as it's expressed here. I have without question spoken out about my concerns regarding investment in open source ILS development in the last few years. IF I did say this, it feels like it's used a little out of context -- or maybe the better characterization is over-simplistically -- in the report.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I think there are still major problems -- many of which we really don't know how to solve effectively, and which call for sustained and extensive research and development -- in various areas where ILS get involved in information discovery and the support of research and teaching. While I'm not opposed to seeing an open source ILS -- who could be? -- and recognize that it could be very useful, particularly as a platform for research and future innovation, open source re-implementation of current ILS functionality will not be a panacea for these still-unsolved challenges.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'd like to thank Lynch for being willing to respond publicly about this. This report has plenty of holes in it, and according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27_Law">esr's characterization of Linus' Law</a>, "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." Let's show SirsiDynix that this is one of the most truly important values with open source.</p>
