In September 2016, the <abbr title="International Council on Archives">ICA</abbr> [Expert Group on Archival Description](http://www.ica.org/en/about-egad) (EGAD) released an initial draft of Records in Context (RiC), a two-part standard for archival description that "reconciles, integrates, and builds on the four existing standards" maintained by ICA: [ISAD(G)](http://www.ica.org/en/isadg-general-international-standard-archival-description-second-edition), [ISAAR(CPF)](http://www.ica.org/en/isaar-cpf-international-standard-archival-authority-record-corporate-bodies-persons-and-families-2nd), [ISDF](http://www.ica.org/en/isdf-international-standard-describing-functions), and [ISDIAH](http://www.ica.org/en/isdiah-international-standard-describing-institutions-archival-holdings). The release was a draft version of [RiC-CM](http://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/RiC-CM-0.1.pdf), a conceptual model model for archival description. As part of this release, an open comment period of just under three months. These are my own long overdue comments on the draft and process.

The comment period has produced 

* RiC-CM draft <http://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/RiC-CM-0.1.pdf>

Work of EGAD is to develop a descriptive standard based on archival principles; current term is to do that in context that "reconciles, integrates, and builds on the four existing standards": ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), ISDF, and ISDIAH.

> EGAD has begun its work by developing RiC-CM and, within RiC-CM, identifying and defining the primary descriptive entities and their interrelations that constitute archival description. EGAD has focused on describing the world from an archival perspective, that is, a perspective situated in the specific mandate of archives and grounded in the fundamental assumptions and principles that govern the activities performed in fulfilment of the mandate.


> RiC-CM also does not yet offer a model of the role of the archivist and the activities he or she performs in the formulation and ongoing maintenance of
description. EGAD will extend the model in this respect as a next step.

> The development of the RiC-O is in the preliminary stages. Full development is pending a stable draft of RiC-CM, as the ontology must be aligned with the conceptual model. RiC-O will translate RiC-CM using the W3C standard OWL.

Which version of OWL? 

> RiC-O will provide the archival community with the ability to make archival description available using the techniques of Linked Open Data (LOD) and employ a conceptual vocabulary and structure that is specific to archival description.

> The first draft of RiC-O will be made available in late 2016.

Where is it?

> RiC will, furthermore, be of interest to the allied cultural heritage communities. Integrated access to cultural heritage held by libraries, archives, museums, and curated cultural sites and monuments is increasingly the focus of professional communities, policymakers, funding agencies, and user communities. Different cultural heritage communities have fundamentally different understandings of the nature of the objects for which they have curatorial responsibility. These understandings and practices are well-established and adapted (and adapting) to the particular challenges of each community and the nature of the objects in their care. While many of the efforts to realize the objective of integrated access have focused on developing a shared standard for description, reducing the different descriptive practices to one is intellectually and politically challenging. This objective, though, does not require such a reduction, as the communities need only identify and cooperate where there are shared (or largely shared) concepts and practices. RiC-O will facilitate aligning archival description with the description of allied professionals where there is conceptual overlap, furthering efforts to provide integrated access to cultural heritage.

OK, so where do other models fit in?

> It is essential that developers of records management and record description and access systems are part of RiCâ€™s audience. RiC is detailed and complex, and therefore successful implementation and use will require the development of methods that will ameliorate the intellectual, technological, and economic challenge of data creation and maintenance.

How has ICA-EGAD engaged with these developers? What does successful implementation look like for a conceptual model and a thus far unpublished ontology?
