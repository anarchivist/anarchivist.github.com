<p>Thanks to the wonderful people at <a href="http://ibiblio.org/">ibiblio</a>, ArchivesBlogs will be changing hosts! If you're not familiar with ibiblio, it's one of the largest and oldest public digital library collections on the Internet. In addition to the upcoming hosting of ArchivesBlogs, ibiblio also hosts <a href="http://librarian.net/">librarian.net</a> and <a href="http://www.libraryweb.info/">Library Web</a>. Pardon any interruptions in access given the  impending move; everything should be settled within a few days.</p>
<p>Also, a few changes I've made to the backend should fix most of the continuing issues with certain feeds not aggregating. Let me know if there are any problems that still occur.</p>
