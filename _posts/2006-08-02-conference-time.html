<p>I'm one of <a href="http://www.foldering.com/?p=4">several</a> <a href="http://www.librarian.net/stax/1804">bloggers</a> attending the <a href="http://www.archivists.org/conference/dc2006/index.asp"><abbr title="Society of American Archivists">SAA</abbr> conference</a> the rest of this week. Nothing against CoSA or NAGARA, but I'm attending the conference for the organization to which I belong. My schedule is pretty packed, and if you're <a href="http://sun3.lib.uci.edu/~murrizol/ts_history/tshist.htm">one of us</a> be sure to attend the Description Section meeting since I'm running for Vice-Chair.</p>
