<p>Amidst this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google's_hoaxes#2008">week of notorious hoaxes</a>, Google has <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2008/03/google-message-discovery-now-available.html">launched</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/security/archive.html">Google Message Discovery</a> as an enterprise-focused add on for its <a href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> platform. Google Message Discovery goes well beyond a simple and reliable e-mail backup system and provides three key features of interest to records managers:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content-addressable storage</a> for electronic mail stored immediately upon sending or retrieval</li>
<li>Creating explicit retention policies based upon time</li>
<li>Compliance with relevant laws and best practices</li>
<li>Straightforward discovery for any use, regardless if internal or concerning litigation</li>
</ol>
<p>Google Message Discovery, as well as other <a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/security/index.html">related offerings</a> such as e-mail security, clearly has its origins in Google's <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/weve-officially-acquired-postini.html">acquisition</a> of <a href="http://www.postini.com/">Postini</a> last year. Postini isn't some startup with dubious or perpetually beta offerings (e.g. Dodgeball or GrandCentral); some of their better known clients include BASF and  Merrill Lynch. At $25 per user per year, the service seems to be an incredible steal.</p>
