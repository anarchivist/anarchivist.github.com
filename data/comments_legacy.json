From the sound of it, I bet you have a hard time slowing down, don't you? But a happy life is a balanced life.

Let go of the way you think things should be right now and open up to accept what is...whatever it is. I'm amused that even in your exhausted state of mind you are making lists of things that might help. It makes me smile because I was once the same way and I've had to force myself to stop trying to control everything. You just can't do it. And that barrier you're speaking of is something you can't control right now. You can waste time trying to get over it, under it, around it -- and have a miserable summer full of frustration.

I disagree about surrounding yourself with smart people alone as well as engaging in conversations that don't excite you. We are more than our I.Q. -- we are emotions, we are dreamers, we are all striving for the same basic things regardless of our test scores. And besides, people are smart in different ways. You know that. LET GO. Talk to interesting people. Talk to strangers. Talk about things that do excite you. Stop making rules. Break the rules. Find balance.

At conferences, when listening to the first 5 minutes or so of the beginning of any talk, I'm trying to assess where the speaker is coming from. Are they talking to me, a digitally-minded archivist with a background heavy in theory but a heart that bleeds for under-represented communities and thrills at new ways to interact with archives? I wonder this because I've found that if they are not, in fact, talking to me, the room can get downright hostile. This speaks to the larger problem in our profession of segregating the academics from the practitioners, the technologically-minded from the analogue, the traditional from the 'post-modern'.</p><p>I'm rambling a bit but I'll try to summarize. What I want to build is a profession where we can all just get along (I couldn't resist, haha!). We could build something so much better if we all talked to each other without brandishing hostility towards the different kinds of archivists, including the ones who are librarians and including the ones who are historians/genealogists/etc. I don't think you need agreement to have unity. Maybe we could all start tailoring our talks so that the whole room knows we're engaging them no matter where they fall on the archivist spectrum. Get deep, get serious, but in the first few minutes, maybe we could start by channeling our hostility into statements of purpose - that is, tell me what you want to build or how you see our world and put some heart in it.

I'd be curious to know what is the same, and what is missing. Over the last year, largely due to me following along in your and Tim's footsteps, I've found myself daydreaming about improved editing environments for archival description, that actually use some of the Linked Data collections that are out there now. I explored this a teensy bit on <a href=\"http://jobs.code4lib.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"jobs.code4lib.org\">jobs.code4lib.org</a>. I guess I need to play with Twine and investigate some of the stories you've linked out to here to see what the state of play is.</p><p>You mentioned Facebook. I'm not a huge user, or fan of their strategy to commoditize people's lives and emotions. But one thing they really got right is giving people an audience to create for. When people share photos, status updates, or links to stories elsewhere, they are aware of who they are sharing with, are able to see (via likes and comments) the effects that their content has had on others, and they can use that feedback to cultivate their audience, and their future content. It seems like this is something that archives are missing.</p><p>I would like to help make archives be more personal: to provide a social context for description, that lets archivists do their work more collaboratively, and creatively, while acknowledging their voice -- and hopefully bootstrapping description by others who are outside of the profession. That's when things take on a political flavor.

However, I am glad that my post triggered you to compose such an eloquent and useful statement regarding your 'ArchivesBlogs' project. I started reading blogs about archives when seeking information about presentations from the SAA Washington, D.C. conference. Jeanne Kramer-Smyth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and RLG's Hanging Together both provided helpful postings which relayed much useful information to the inquisitive yet not-in-attendance archivist.  To this emerging archival blogger community, I would like to extend my gratitude and offer my sincerest respect, whatever that may be worth. I have a suspicion that blogging will take on an increasingly important role in information dissemination at future SAA conferences.</p><p>As the administrator of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcArchivesBlogs,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mark you should obviously feel free to add, remove and edit feeds however you see fit. However, one way to keep \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcArchivesBlogs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on track might be to feed relevant tags from blogs, instead of feeds representing the blog itself. For instance, I have a slight suspicion that ArchivesBlogs readers are not going to want to see some of the rubbish I post on my blog such as my on going quest to read every possible interpretation of the historian Perry Miller.</p><p>The power of blogging is evinced when communities or networks occur in which people participate in open debate, and share ideas about which they harbor thoughtful care. It is at this precise moment however, when unsettling aspects of our 2.0 identities arise, as bloggers become more than strangers firing missives off into the ether. We become known to one another through our written thought.  However obvious this point may be, I find it very disconcerting as at times I do not wish to amplify my ideas as loud as blogging is capable.  I should have thought about this before writing a post and linking back to ArchivesBlogs, and instead written a more discrete e-mail.</p><p>Now that the damage is done, and I have made my presence felt (even if only to you Mark) I would like to let you know that I am an archivist (note: not an anarchivist,) a graduate student (at the CUNY Graduate Center) and an avid user of library catalogs. I believe we both have B.A.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in philosophy, enjoy music and our roughly the same age.

I found your site tonight by randomly selecting from a list posted at the exciting blog Bibliodyssey (great set of links).  So what about listing links to other bookish sites along your margin here?  Interesting sites tend to do this.<br>2.  Earlier today I googled the library because I was searching for a specific text.  However, your interesting site does not come up thru googling your library using the terms \"new york public library index\".  Not readily anyway, i just tried it again to make sure.  What about you being more of the online social face of nypl?<br>3.  Now, the book I was looking for is a Harvard-Yenching Institute Concordance of Chinese Characters used in the Chuang Tzu, recommended as useful by all the serious translators, but I've never seen a copy and there's nothing on googlebooks.  (I am doing my own translation for a version I'm illustrating.)

So here is a social function you could perform by sharing some scans online (I'm in northern New Hampshire).  If there was sort of a person at an online window who was interested in helping users this way, I think that would be a very good way to innovate your site.  What do you think?

Actually I noticed that the page prompted by the url listed in #3 offers some sort of possibility of doing this, but the way the page looks I feel as though I am not \"authorized\" or something, that I may not do it right in some way, so then I demur.  So this is an interesting interface problem.  How to induce the user to use all the functionality of the catalogue index interface?  After all, this is a basic function for the library and the user.<br>Thanks, I think your blog looks very promising here.  Love the library, btw...
