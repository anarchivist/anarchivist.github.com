#### Hydra in a Box

The [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la/) (DPLA), Stanford University and DuraSpace are partnering to extend the existing Hydra project codebase and its vibrant and growing community to build, bundle, and promote a feature-rich, robust, flexible digital repository that is easy to install, configure, and maintain. This next-generation repository solution -- "Hydra-in-a-Box" -- will work for institutions large and small, incorporating the capabilities and affordances to support networked resources and services in a shared, sustainable, national platform. The overall intent is to develop a digital collections platform that is not just "on the web," but "of the web." With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the 30-month collaborative project launched in May 2015 and is currently in the Product Design phase.

#### International Rights Statements Working Group

Europeana, the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), and many other libraries, archives and other cultural heritage institutions believe that everyone should be able to engage with their cultural heritage online. We can help achieve this by giving cultural heritage institutions simple and standardized terms to summarize the copyright status of Works in their collection and how they may be used. These simple and standardized terms we call "rights statements." The International Rights Statements Working Group is developing a vocabulary in SKOS/RDF used for these generalized rights statements, which are intended for broad use.

#### ArchivesSpace

A project funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to build a best of breed, next-generation archival management system to serve as the sucessor for [Archivists' Toolkit](http://archiviststoolkit.org/) and [Archon](http://archon.org/). Since July 2011, I have been the project's Technical Architect and product owner. In the summer of 2010, I organized a technical planning meeting for the ArchivesSpace planning grant and wrote a [report](http://www.archivesspace.org/documents/reports/ "ArchivesSpace Technical Architecture Report, July 2010") summarizing the recommended actions and decisions.
