#### ArchivesSpace

A project funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to build a best of breed, next-generation archival management system to serve as the sucessor for [Archivists' Toolkit](http://archiviststoolkit.org/) and [Archon](http://archon.org/). Since July 2011, I have been the project's Technical Architect and product owner. In the summer of 2010, I organized a technical planning meeting for the ArchivesSpace planning grant and wrote a [report](http://www.archivesspace.org/documents/reports/ "ArchivesSpace Technical Architecture Report, July 2010") summarizing the recommended actions and decisions.
